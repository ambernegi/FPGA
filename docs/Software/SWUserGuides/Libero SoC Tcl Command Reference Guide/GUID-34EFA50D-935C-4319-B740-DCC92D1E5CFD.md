# sb\_add\_core

## Description

This Tcl command is used to add cores to Master/Slave subsystems in the<br /> **Peripherals** page of the System Builder<br /> component.

**Note:** There are two types of cores that can be added using the `sb_add_core` command.

1.  One type is of actual cores like CoreI2C, CoreGPIO with fixed core versions available in the **Peripherals** page. If, for example, CoreI2C is added to a subsystem with core\_name specified as i2c\_peripheral and a core count of 4, then the actual instance names of CoreI2C added will be i2c\_peripheral\_0, i2c\_peripheral\_1, i2c\_peripheral\_2 and i2c\_peripheral\_3 in the generated design.
2.  Second type of cores are Fabric AMBA Slave and Fabric AMBA Master. Adding them to a subsystem will configure the bus core of the subsystem to enable and expose master/slave interfaces of the bus core on the generated System Builder component to be connected to actual masters/slaves in the fabric. If, for example, Fabric AMBA Slave configured as AHBLite\(`AMBA_INTERFACE_TYPE:AHBLITE`\) is added to a subsystem with core\_name specified as ahb\_slave and a core count of 4, then the CoreAHBLite bus core of that subsystem will be configured to enable and expose 4 AHBLite slave bus interfaces with names ahb\_slave, ahb\_slave\_1, ahb\_slave\_2 and ahb\_slave\_3 on the System Builder component to be connected to actual slave peripherals in the fabric.

```
sb_add_core \
-component_name {component_name} \
-core_vlnv {vendor:library:name:version} \
[-core_name {core_name}] \
-subsystem_name {subsystem_name}

```

## Arguments

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|-component\_name \{component\_name\}|string|Mandatory. Name of the system builder component.|
|-core\_vlnv \{vendor:library:name:version\}|string|Mandatory. Version identifier of the core being instantiated in<br /> the SmartDesign.|
|-core\_name \{core\_name\}|string|Optional. Name of the instance of the core in the System Builder<br /> component. If no details are provided, the instance name will be<br /> automatically defined as `<vlnv_core_name>_n`<br /> \(where `n` starts at 0\).|
|-subsystem\_name \{subsystem\_name\}|string|Mandatory. Name of the subsystem the core is being added<br /> to.|

## Example

```
sb_add_core -component_name {sb} -core_vlnv {Actel:SystemBuilder:AMBA_SLAVE:0.0.102} -core_name {AMBA_SLAVE_0} -subsystem_name {FIC0_Master_Subsystem}
```
