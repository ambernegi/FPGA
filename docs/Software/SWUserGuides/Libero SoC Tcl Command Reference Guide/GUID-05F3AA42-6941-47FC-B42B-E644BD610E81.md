# Building a Libero Design Using Tcl

Microchipâ€™s Libero SoC Design Suite enables the rapid development of FPGA designs by<br /> offering a comprehensive set of industry-standard third-party tools. It also offers a<br /> rich IP library for various applications such as Communications, Networking, Imaging and<br /> Video, Industrial, Defense, and Aerospace.

Tcl commands help facilitate the end-to-end design flow automation. Libero SoC supports<br /> Tcl scripting, which facilitates the automation of end-to-end design flow from HDL to<br /> programming. This chapter describes how the HDL to programming flow is executed in the<br /> Libero SoC Design Suite using Tcl, how to run the Tcl, and how to update a project with<br /> the updated HDL and constraints files.
