# download\_latest\_cores

## Description

This Tcl command is used to download the latest cores into the vault. A project does not need to be open to run this command. This command takes no arguments. The **Catalog Options** dialog box enables you to customize your Catalog. **Display only the latest version of a core** is checked by default. This option, if checked, shows the latest versions of cores that are not in the Vault, and also filters out any duplicate cores that have the same Vendor, Library, and Name, with an earlier version number.

**Important:**

-   If there are no cores to be downloaded, you will see the following message:

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_MXC_NTN_42C}
    Info:All the latest cores are present in the vault.
    ```

-   If there is no internet access, you will see the following message:

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_OPJ_PTN_42C}
    Cannot download cores. Please make sure you're connected to the internet and internet access is not disabled from the Preferences.
    ```
