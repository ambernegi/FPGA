# Floating License Daemon Support

Microchip now supports 64-bit floating licensing daemons with FlexLM v11.19 for Libero SoC Design Suite \(actlmgrd\) that include Synopsys Synplify Pro/Identity Pro® ME \(snpslmd\) and Siemens ModelSim/QuestaSim*®* ME \(saltd,which replaces the previous mgcld\).

Before opening Libero SoC v2025.1, perform the following procedure to upgrade your systems:

1.  Upgrade existing daemons from v11.16 to v11.19. The v11.19 daemons available for downloading appear under the **Daemons Downloads** link on the following Microchip web page: [https://www.microchip.com/libero](https://www.microchip.com/libero).
2.  Install the upgraded license available on your microchipDIRECT account \(Microchip updated all existing active floating licenses to support the new saltd daemons\): [https://www.microchipdirect.com/fpga-software-products](https://www.microchipdirect.com/fpga-software-products).

This bundle is backward-compatible with all previous Libero SoC releases.

Starting with Libero SoC v2024.2, the latest 64-bit license daemons with FlexLM v11.19 are<br /> required for all floating license users. For all current floating license users who recently<br /> received a new license file due to renewal or upgrade, please download and set up the latest<br /> daemons as well.
