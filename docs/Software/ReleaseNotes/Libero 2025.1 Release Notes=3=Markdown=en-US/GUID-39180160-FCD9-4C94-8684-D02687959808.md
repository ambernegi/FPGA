# Block Design Methodology: Propagate Chip-Level Hardwired Connections to the Top Module

Libero SoC v2025.1 adds support to propagate chip-level hardwired connections \(for<br /> example, OSC\_RC50MHZ, CCC to DELCAL\) to the top module in block mode for SmartFusion2, IGLOO2,<br /> and RTG4 devices. This support resolves previous compile and layout issues specific to block<br /> design methodology.
