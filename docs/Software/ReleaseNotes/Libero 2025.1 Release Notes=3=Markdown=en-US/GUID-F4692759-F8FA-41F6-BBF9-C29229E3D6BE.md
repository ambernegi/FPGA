# RTG4FCCCECALIB: Update Core Configuration GUI to Dynamically Disable Unused Fields in Specific Modes

In the Libero SoC v2025.1 release, the RTG4FCCCECALIB core configuration GUI has been<br /> enhanced. Frequency fields in the Basic and Advanced tabs are now grayed out and disabled when<br /> the requested mode does not use the PLL or GPDs.

For example, when using the Clock Recovery Circuit as the source for a specific CCC output,<br /> the reference clock and requested output frequency fields are disabled. Similarly, when the<br /> PLL is bypassed, such as when using the internal 50MHz RC Oscillator or a direct CCC input as<br /> the source for a specific CCC output, the unused **Exact Frequency**<br /> checkbox is disabled.
