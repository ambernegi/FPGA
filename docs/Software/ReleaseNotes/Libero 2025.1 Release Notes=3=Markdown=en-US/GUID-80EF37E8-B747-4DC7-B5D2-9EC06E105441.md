# IOD RX\_CLK\_ODT\_EN for LVDS Failsafe

-   Connected RX\_CLK\_P to HS\_IO\_CLK when “Clock to Data Relationship” is dynamic, centered, or aligned.
-   New ODT\_EN LVDS Failsafe functionality for 'IOD\_RX' core allows users to avoid time-zero failures when the clock-to-data relationship is not fractional.
