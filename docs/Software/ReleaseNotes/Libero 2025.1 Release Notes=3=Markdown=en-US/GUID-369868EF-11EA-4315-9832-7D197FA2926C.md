# Ability to Perform Static Timing Analysis at IND Temp-range for MIL and T2 Devices

With the Libero SoC v2025.1 release, projects targeting PolarFire family FPGA and SoC<br /> device part numbers offered in MIL or automotive T2 temperature grade now include a<br /> **Project Settings** option for selecting the IND range for<br /> Analysis Operating Conditions used by static timing and power analysis. This enhancement<br /> allows designers using MIL or T2 devices in systems that do not operate beyond the IND<br /> range to analyze static timing and power at more applicable conditions.
