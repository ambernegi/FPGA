# MDIO Management

Control and status is provided to and from the PHY through the two-wire MDIO management interface described in IEEE802.3u Clause22.

The MDIO write/read cycles are requested through the APB target. MAC performs a<br /> write cycle using the MDIO\_PHYID, register address and 16-bit write data. MAC performs a<br /> read cycle using the MDIO\_PHYID register address and updates the sixteen-bit read data<br /> into the MDIO Management STATUS Register, which can be read through APB target.
