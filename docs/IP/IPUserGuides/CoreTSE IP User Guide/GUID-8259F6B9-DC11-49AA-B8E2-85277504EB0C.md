# Station Address Logic for Frame Filtering

This module provides a mechanism to statistically filter frames not intended for this node.

The MAC core performs DA comparison on all the received frames and provides three information signals: UCAD \(Perfect DA match\), MCAD, and BCAD along with seven most significant bits of the resulting CRC of DA. This information is used to perform a hashing algorithm, compare the result to a programmable hash table and then communicate to the FIFO logic to either delete or store the frame.

The programmability allows the user to assert any bits in a 128 bit hash table that corresponds to the desired Ethernet MAC DA. If the corresponding bit in the table is set, the frame is accepted. In addition, hashing can selectively be performed on unicast addresses or multicast addresses.
