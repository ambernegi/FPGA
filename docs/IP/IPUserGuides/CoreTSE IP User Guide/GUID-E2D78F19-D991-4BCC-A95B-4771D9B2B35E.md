# Triple Speed MAC

This core is a full-featured 10/100/1000 Mbps MAC with standard G/MII. The MAC has built in G/MII to TBI converter, which supports 1000 Mbps with TBI. The core is capable of full-duplex operation at 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps and of half duplex operation at 10 and 100 Mbps.

In half-duplex mode, the MAC adheres to the Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detect Access method as defined in IEEE 802.3 and its several supplements including IEEE 802.3u. In full-duplex mode, the MAC follows IEEE 802.3x, which ignores both carrier and collisions. Following each packet transmission or abortion, a transmit statistics vector is used for statistics collection.

The external PHY device presents packets to the MAC. The MAC scans the preamble<br /> searching for the Start Frame Delimiter \(SFD\). When the SFD is found, the preamble and<br /> SFD are stripped and the frame is passed to the system. Following each frame reception,<br /> a Receive Statistics Vector \(RSV\) is used for frame filtering and statistics<br /> collection.

CoreTSE supports PAUSE control frames. This core also includes optional support<br /> for Wake-on-LAN \(WoL\) module. The WoL module detects both IEEE 802.3-compliant unicast<br /> frames with a destination address that matches the station address and packets that use<br /> AMD’s Magic Packet™ Detection technology. The detection<br /> functionality can be enabled or disabled.
