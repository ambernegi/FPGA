# Inter-Frame-Gap

MACRL provides the capability to filter frames that have less than a certain<br /> inter-frame-gap. The standard states that the inter-frame-gap should be 160 bit-times.<br /> This includes 96 bits of inter packet gap \(IPG\), 56 bits of preamble and 8 bits of start<br /> frame delimiter \(SFD\). To protect downstream logic from over-running, MACRL can be<br /> programmed with a minimum inter frame gap \(IFG\) parameter. The second of two<br /> back-to-back frames to violate the minimum IFG is dropped.
