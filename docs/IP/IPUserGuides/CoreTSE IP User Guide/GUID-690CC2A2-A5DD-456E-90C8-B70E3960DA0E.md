# Introduction

The CoreTSE provides 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet Media Access Controller \(MAC\) with a Gigabit<br /> Media Independent Interface \(G/MII\) or Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface \(SGMII\) Ten<br /> Bit Interface \(TBI\) to support 1000BASE-T and 1000BASE-X.

The CoreTSE has the following major interfaces:

-   G/MII or SGMII TBI physical layer \(PHY\) interface connects to Ethernet PHY
-   Management Data Input or Output \(MDIO\) interface to communicate with the MDIO Manageable Device \(MMD\) in the PHY
-   MAC data path interface
-   Advanced Peripheral Bus \(APB\) - Target interface for MAC configuration registers and status counters access

A triple speed MAC core is responsible for the main functionalities of CoreTSE which are<br /> listed as follows:

-   Statistics gathering - Statistics information is gathered from the data transmitted and received over the Ethernet link.
-   Station address functions - Station address \(SAL\) feature provides address filtering capability.

The following figure shows the block diagram of CoreTSE.

Licensing

</td><td>

<br /> CoreTSE is available in the following license versions: Evaluation, Obfuscated<br /> and RTL<br /> -   **Evaluation**: Evaluation version is available for free and supports user testbench simulations and four hours of the functionality on silicon.
-   **Obfuscated**: Obfuscated version is license locked and supports user testbench simulations and unlimited functionality on silicon.
-   **RTL**: Complete encrypted RTL source code is provided for the core.

Installation Instructions

</td><td>

CoreTSE must be installed to the **IP Catalog** of Libero SoC automatically<br /> through the IP Catalog update function. Alternatively, CoreTSE could be manually<br /> downloaded from the catalog. Once the IP core is installed, it is configured,<br /> generated, and instantiated SmartDesign within for inclusion in the project.
