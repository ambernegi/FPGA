# Jumbo Frame Support

The CoreTSE supports jumbo frames that exceed the 1500 byte maximum of the standard Ethernet frame. When using jumbo frames the amount of idles that are present in the systems reduced and therefore the frequency of clock compensation events are lower. When supporting jumbo frames the clocking tolerance between the transmit clock and the receive clock is required to be 0 ppm to account for the reduction in idles.

The Jumbo frame length transmitted/received by the CoreTSE is according to Maximum Frame Length \(0x010\) register configuration and supports up to 4000 bytes only.
