# Simulation Flows

SmartDesign and Libero SoC facilitate running a user testbench for CoreTSE. To run the user<br /> testbench, perform the following steps.

1.  Select the User testbench flow in the core configurator GUI. When the core is generated Libero installs the user testbench files. After the files are generated.

2.  Set the design root to the CoreTSE top level module in the **Libero Design Hierarchy** pane

3.  Set the CoreTSE testbench top level module as active stimulus in the **Libero Stimulus Hierarchy** pane, and then click **Simulation** option in the **Libero Design Flow** pane. This invokes ModelSimÂ® and automatically runs the simulation.
