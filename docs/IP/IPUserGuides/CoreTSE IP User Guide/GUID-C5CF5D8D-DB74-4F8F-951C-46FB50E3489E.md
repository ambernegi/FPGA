# Address Detect

MACRL scans the frame and determine its address type. The 48-bit programmed station address is compared to each receive frameâ€™s DA. When they match, the unicast address detect \(UCAD\) is asserted. If the broadcast address is detected, MACRL asserts broadcast address detect \(BCAD\). If a multicast address is detected, the MAC asserts multicast address detect \(MCAD\).
