The MTXDAT \(transmit data\) word is recorded into MAC transmit FIFO on rising<br /> edge of MTXCLK upon the assertion of MTXRDY and MTXACPT and the MTXSOF should be<br /> asserted for the first word transfer of the frame. Transmit data stored into MAC<br /> transmit FIFO until MTXEOF \(end of frame date\). MTXBYTEVALID indicates the byte enables<br /> of the MTXDAT last word. MTXACPT is asserted when CoreTSE is capable of receiving at<br /> least one word from the MAC data path transmit interface. MTXACPT should<br /> be monitored for every transmission.
