# Clocks

The IP core uses the following clocks:

-   **PCLK** – Clock input for APB interface.
-   **MTXCLK** – Clock input for MAC data path transmit interface.
-   **MRXCLK** – Clock input for MAC data path receive interface.
-   **TBI\_TX\_CLK** – 125 MHz clock input for TBI transmit interface. This clock is connected to the Transmit clock from the Transceiver. This clock is available only in TBI mode.
-   **TXCLK** – 125/25/2.5 MHz clock input for G/MII interface/MAC operations in 1000/100/10 Mbps data-rate respectively. In TBI mode, this clock is generated from TBI\_TX\_CLK. In G/MII mode, this clock is connected to the Transmit clock from the G/MII PHY.
-   **TBI\_RX\_CLK** – 125 MHz clock input for TBI receive interface. This clock is connected to the Receive clock from the Transceiver. This clock is available only in TBI mode.
-   **RXCLK** – 125/25/2.5 MHz clock input for G/MII interface/MAC operations in 1000/100/10 Mbps data-rate respectively. In TBI mode, this clock is generated from TBI\_RX\_CLK. In G/MII mode, this clock is connected to the Receive clock from the G/MII PHY.
-   **MDC** – Management clock output for MDIO interface. This clock is generated by the IP core. PCLK is the source clock. The MGMT CLOCK SELECT field of MDIO Mgmt: Configuration register \(address 0x020\) determines the frequency of this clock.
