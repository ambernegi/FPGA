# HOST FILTER FRAMES \(HSTFLTRFRM\)

ValueDescription17Unicast frame detected but did not match configured station address.16Receive Frame Truncated.15Receive Long Event.14Receive VLAN Tag Detected: Frames length/type field contained 0x8100 which is the VLAN Protocol Identifier.13Receive Unsupported Op-code: Current Frame was recognized as a Control frame by the PEMCS, but it contains an unknown Op-code.12Receive PAUSE Control Frame: Current frame was recognized as a Control frame containing a valid PAUSE Frame Op-code and a valid address.11Receive Control Frame: Current Frame was recognized as a Control frame for having a valid Type-Length designation.10Receive Dribble Nibble: Indicates that after the end of the packet an additional 1 to 7 bits were received. A single nibble, called the dribble nibble, is formed but not sent to the system \(10/100 Mbps only\).9Receive Broadcast: Packets destination address contained the broadcast address.8Receive Multicast: Packets destination address contained a multicast address.7Receive OK. Frame contained a valid CRC and did not have a code error.6Receive Length Out of Range: Indicates that frames length was larger than 1,518 bytes but smaller than the hosts maximum frame length value \(type field\).5Receive Length Check Error: Indicates that frame length field value in the packet does not match the actual data byte length and is not a type field.4Receive CRC Error: Packets CRC did not match the internally generated CRC.3Receive Code Error: One or more nibbles were signaled as errors during the reception of the packet.2Receive False Carrier: Indicates that at some time since the last receive statistics vector, a false carrier was detected, noted, and reported with this the next receive statistics. The false carrier is not associated with this packet. False carrier is an activity on the receive channel that does not result in a packet receive attempt being made. Defined to be RXER = 1, RXDV = 0, RXD\[3:0\] = 0xE \(RXD\[7:0\] = 0x0E\).1Receive RXDV Event: Indicates that the last receive event seen was not long enough to be a valid packet.0Receive Previous Packet Dropped as IFG is small.
