# TBI Mode

In TBI mode, the following test case is available:

1.  Auto negotiation test case
    -   Configure MDIO registers using APB Target register interface for Auto negotiation restart &amp; enable.
    -   Waits for auto negotiation completion.
    -   Verifies the Auto negation status in MDIO registers and ANX\_STATE port status.
2.  TBI near end loopback test case
    -   Configures MAC registers for full duplex and specific speed mode of operation
    -   Test case waits few clocks forÂ  CoreTSE to transmit and looped back at TBI interface
    -   MAC Data path RX Target model receives the looped back packet and testbench checks for data integrity.
    -   Above steps are repeated for 10/100/1000 speed modes with for loop of few iterations.
