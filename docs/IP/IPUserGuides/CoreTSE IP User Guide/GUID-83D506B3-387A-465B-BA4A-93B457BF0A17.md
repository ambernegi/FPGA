# G/MII Mode

In G/MII mode, the following test cases are available:

1.  G/MII near end loopback test case
    -   Configures MAC registers for full duplex and specific speed mode of operation.
    -   Test case waits few clocks for CoreTSE to transmit and looped back at G/MII interface.
    -   MAC Data path RX Target model receives the looped back packet and testbench checks for data integrity.
    -   Above steps are repeated for 10/100/1000 speed modes with for loop of few iterations.
