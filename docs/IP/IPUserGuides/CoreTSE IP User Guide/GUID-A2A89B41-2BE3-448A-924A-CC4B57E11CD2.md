# Length Checking and Maximum Length Enforcement

MACRL can optionally compare the length field with the actual length of the data field portion of the frame. This is enabled through the MAC Configuration \#2 register. MACRL first determines if the length/type field is a valid length. If so, it is compared with the data field length and any mismatches are updated to the receive statistics.

MACRL can limit the length of receive frames passed to the system. The maximum length is programmed through the Maximum Frame Length register. Frames which exceed this maximum are truncated.
