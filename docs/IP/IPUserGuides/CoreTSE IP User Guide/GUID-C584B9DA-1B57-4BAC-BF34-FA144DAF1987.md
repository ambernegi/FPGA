# User Testbench

A simplified block diagram of the user testbench is shown in the following figure. The user testbench instantiates the CoreTSE with near end loopback at TBI/G/MII interface. Testbench provides behavioral, non-synthesizable MAC data path interface models for descriptors and MAC configurations.
