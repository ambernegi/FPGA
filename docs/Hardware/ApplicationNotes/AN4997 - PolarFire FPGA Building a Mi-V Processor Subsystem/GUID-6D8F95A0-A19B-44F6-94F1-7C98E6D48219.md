    The design hierarchy is built, and the `top_derived_contraints.sdc` file is generated in the project folder.

    In the dialog box that appears, click **Yes** to associate the SDC file to the **Synthesis**, **Place and Route**, and **Timing Verification** tools, as shown in the following figure.
