# Creating a Mi-V SoftConsole Project

To create a Mi-V SoftConsole project, perform the following steps:

1.  Create a SoftConsole workspace folder on the host PC for storing SoftConsole projects. For example, `D:\Tutorial\MiV_Workspace`.
2.  Start SoftConsole.
3.  In the **Workspace Launcher** dialog box, paste `D:\Tutorial\MiV_Workspace` as the workspace location, and click **Launch**, as shown in the following figure.

    When the workspace is successfully created, the SoftConsole<br /> main window opens.

4.  Select **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Project**, as shown in the following figure.

6.  Click **Next**.
7.  In the **C Project** dialog box, perform the following steps:
    -   Enter a name for the project in the **Project name** field. For example, MiV\_uart\_blinky.
    -   In the **Project type** pane, expand **Executable**, and select **Empty Project** and the **Toolchains** as **RISC-V Cross GCC**, as shown in the following figure. Then, click **Next**.
