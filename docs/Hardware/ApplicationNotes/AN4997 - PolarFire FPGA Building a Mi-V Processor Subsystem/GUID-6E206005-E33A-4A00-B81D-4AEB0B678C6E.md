3.  Copy all of the content of the `main.c` from `DesignFiles_directory\FW`, and paste it in the `main.c` file of the SoftConsole project.
4.  Save the SoftConsole `main.c` file.
5.  Similarly, create another file named `hw_platform.h`.
6.  Copy all of the content of the `hw_platform.h` from the `DesignFiles_directory\FW`, and paste it in the newly created `hw_platform.h` file.

**Important:** The `hw_platform.h` file includes the system clock frequency, baud rate, and base addresses of peripherals. The `hw_platform.h` file appears, as shown in the following figure.
