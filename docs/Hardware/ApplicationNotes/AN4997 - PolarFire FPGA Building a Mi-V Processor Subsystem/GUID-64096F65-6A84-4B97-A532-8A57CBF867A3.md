# Board Setup

To set up the board, perform the following steps:

1.  Ensure that the jumper settings on the board are as listed in the following table.

    |Jumper|Description|
    |:-----|:----------|
    |J18, J19, J20, J21,<br /> J22|Short pins 2 and 3 for<br /> programming the PolarFire FPGA through FTDI.|
    |J28|Short pins 1 and 2 for<br /> programming through the on-board FlashPro5.|
    |J26|Short pins 1 and 2 for<br /> programming through the FTDI SPI.|
    |J27|Short pins 1 and 2 for<br /> programming through the FTDI SPI.|
    |J23|Open pins 1 and 2 for<br /> programming SPI flash.|
    |J4|Short pins 1 and 2 for<br /> manual power switching using SW3|
    |J12|Short pins 3 and 4 for<br /> 2.5V.|

    **Important:** For more information about the Jumper locations on the board, see the silkscreen provided in [UG0747: PolarFire FPGA Evaluation Kit User Guide](https://www.microchip.com/content/dam/mchp/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/microsemi_polarfire_fpga_evaluation_kit_user_guide_ug0747_v5.pdf).

2.  Connect the power supply cable to the J9 connector on the board.
3.  Connect the host PC to the J5 \(USB\) port on the PolarFire Evaluation Board using the USB cable.
4.  Power on the board using the SW3 slide switch.
