# Fabric RAMs Initialization

Each logical RAM instance in the design is initialized from a different<br /> source– sNVM, µPROM, or SPI-Flash. The initialization client storage location is configurable.<br /> Generate the initialization data to add the initialization clients to the chosen non-volatile<br /> memories and program the device. Program SPI-Flash, if chosen as storage location for<br /> initialization data. For more information, see [Configure Design Initialization Data and Memories](GUID-D7546C2C-BCB6-4C95-80B9-52FBC50E4CA7.md).
