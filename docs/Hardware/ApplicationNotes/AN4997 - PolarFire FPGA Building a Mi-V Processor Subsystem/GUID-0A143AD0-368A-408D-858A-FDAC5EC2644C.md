# Design Description

The application notes describes how to create a Mi-V subsystem for<br /> executing user applications. The user application can be stored in µPROM, sNVM, or an<br /> external SPI flash. At device power-up, the PolarFire System Controller initializes the<br /> designated TCM with the user application and releases the system reset. If the user<br /> application is stored in SPI Flash, the System Controller uses the SC\_SPI interface for<br /> reading the user application from SPI Flash. The given user application prints the UART<br /> message “Hello World!” and blinks user LEDs on the board.

The following figure shows the top-level block diagram of the design.
