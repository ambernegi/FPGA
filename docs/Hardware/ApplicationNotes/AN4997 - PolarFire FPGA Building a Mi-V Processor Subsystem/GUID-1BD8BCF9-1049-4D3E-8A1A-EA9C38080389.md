# Serial Terminal Emulation Program \(PuTTY\) Setup

The user application \(`MiV_uart_blinky.hex` file\) prints the string "Hello World!" on the serial terminal through the UART interface.

To set up the serial terminal, perform the following steps :

1.  Start the PuTTY program.
2.  Start Device Manager, note the second-highest COM port number, and use that in the PuTTY configuration. For example, in the list of ports shown in the following figure, COM93 is the port with the second highest number assigned to it.
