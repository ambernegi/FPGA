# Generate Design Initialization Data

1.  Double-click **Generate Design Initialization Data** on the **Design Flow** tab.

    When the design initialization data is generated successfully, a<br /> green tick mark appears next to Generate Design Initialization Data in the Libero<br /> Design flow, and the following messages appear in the Log<br /> window:

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_H5J_SKB_PXB}
    Info: 'Generate design initialization data' has completed successfully.
    ```

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_JZW_SKB_PXB}
    Info: Stage 1 initialization client has been added to sNVM.
    ```

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_TGG_TKB_PXB}
    Info: Stage 2_3 initialization client has been added to sNVM
    ```

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_RYL_TKB_PXB}
    Info: Stage 3 initialization client has been added to SPI.
    ```

2.  Click the **SPI Flash** tab to verify that the bin file has been added, as shown in the following figure.

    **Important:** In order to streamline the SPI-Flash Programming support with FlashPro6, effective from Libero SoC v12.4, the vendor information is replaced with the density of the target memory.
