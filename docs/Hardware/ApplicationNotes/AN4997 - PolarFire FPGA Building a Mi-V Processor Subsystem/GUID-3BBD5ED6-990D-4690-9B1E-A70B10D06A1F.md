# Introduction

Microchip offers the Mi-V processor IP and software toolchain free of cost<br /> to develop RISC-V® processor-based designs. RISC-V, a standard open Instruction Set<br /> Architecture \(ISA\) under the governance of the RISC-V foundation, offers numerous benefits,<br /> which include enabling the open source community to test and improve cores at a faster pace<br /> than closed ISAs.

PolarFire® FPGAs support Mi-V soft processors to run user<br /> applications. The objective of the application notes is to build a Mi-V processor subsystem<br /> that can execute an application from the designated fabric RAMs initialized from the<br /> sNVM/SPI Flash. The application notes also describes how to build a RISC-V application<br /> using SoftConsole and run it on a PolarFire Evaluation Board.
