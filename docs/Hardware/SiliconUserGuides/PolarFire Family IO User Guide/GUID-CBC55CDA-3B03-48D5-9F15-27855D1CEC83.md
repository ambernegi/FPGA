# Programmable Clamp Diode

Both HSIO and GPIO have internal clamp diodes. Clamp diodes help reduce the<br /> voltage level at the input, and are mainly used when the voltage overshoot exceeds the<br /> maximum allowable limit. Although, the HSIO clamp is always ON; it is not a PCI clamp.<br /> PCI clamp is only on GPIO. If signaling levels of the receiver are greater than the<br /> VDDIx of the bank, the clamp diode must be OFF to support hot-swapping insertion. For<br /> more information, see [Cold Sparing and Hot Swap](GUID-AD2B62F0-4034-4F2D-8ECF-293BAAB55E0C.md).

As shown in [Figure â€€ 1](GUID-15B2CA6C-8B5E-4D24-A89D-33DDF52325F5.md#GUID-A8BDB402-8485-457C-8CD0-2DAE5E49B2E2), GPIOs have optional clamp diode to VDDIO \(not to GND\) for complying<br /> to PCI standard. For GPIOs, these clamp diodes can be programmed to be ON or OFF by<br /> using the I/O attribute editor in Libero SoC or by using a PDC command. For HSIO, the<br /> internal clamp diode is always ON.

The following table lists the values for GPIO standards. For HSIO standards, the value is<br /> always ON.

|I/O Standards|Values|
|-------------|------|
|LVCMOS12, LVCMOS15, LVCMOS18, SSTL18I, SSTL18II,<br /> SSTL15I, SSTL15II, HSTL15I, HSTL15II, LVTTL, LVCMOS33, LVCMOS25,<br /> SSTL25I, SSTL25II, SLVS25, HCSL25, LVDS25, RSDS25, MINILVDS25,<br /> SUBLVDS25, PPDS25, LCMDS25|OFF, ON. The default is ON.|
|MIPI25, LVDS18G|OFF, ON. The default is OFF.|
|HSUL18I, HSUL18II, SLVSE15, PCI, SLVS25, SLVS33, HCSL33,<br /> HCSL25, MIPIE33, MIPIE25, LVPECL33, LVPECL25, LVPECLE33, LVDS25, LVDS33,<br /> RSDS25, RSDS33, MINILVDS25, MINILVDS33, SUBLVDS25, SUBLVDS33, PPDS25,<br /> PPDS33, MLVDSE25, BUSLVDSE25, LCMDS25, LCMDS33|ON|

The following PDC command is used for programmable clamp diode settings:

``` {#ID-0000258D}
set_io -CLAMP_DIODE <value>
```

**Important:** The clamp diode is always on for HSUL18I, HSUL18II, SLVSE15, MIPI25, PCI, SLVS33, HCSL33, MIPIE25, LVPECL33, LVPECLE33, LVDS25, LVDS33, RSDS25, RSDS33, MINILVDS25, MINILVDS33, SUBLVDS25, SUBLVDS33, PPDS25, PPDS33, MLVDSE25, and BUSLVDSE25 I/O standards implemented in GPIO bank.
