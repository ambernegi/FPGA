# Supply Voltages for I/O Banks

Multiple I/O banks require the following bank power supplies listed in the table.

|Name|Description|Nominal Operating Voltage|
|----|-----------|-------------------------|
|VDDIx|Supply for I/O circuits in a<br /> bank|For JTAG bank—1.8V/2.5V/3.3VFor GPIO bank—1.2V/1.5V/1.8V/2.5V/3.3VFor HSIO<br /> bank—1.2V/1.5V/1.8V|
|VDD25|Power for corner PLLs and PNVM|2.5V|
|VDD18|Power for programming and HSIO<br /> receiver|1.8V|
|VDDAUXx|Auxiliary supply for I/O circuits.<br /> Auxiliary supply voltage must be set to 2.5 V or 3.3 V and must be<br /> always equal to or higher than VDDIx. See [Table   3](GUID-01F144EE-7AFE-41F1-9D0E-E716716169E6.md#ID-000026A4) GPIO<br /> Mixed Reference Receiver Mode for legal VDDI and VDDAUX<br /> combinations.|Greater than or equal to VDDI. In cases<br /> where VDDI and VDDAUX in a given GPIO bank are both 2.5V or 3.3V, they<br /> must be tied together to the same supply.|
|VREF|VREF is the supply reference voltage<br /> for reference receivers. Each bank can have only one VREF value. VREF<br /> can be externally supplied or internally generated, see [Supply Voltages for I/O Banks](#GUID-F3D5CCA0-B473-416C-976E-79B4AC3A27AE) for<br /> VREF assignment use model for more information.|Depends on the I/O standards|
|VDDIx MSSIO Banks1|Supply for MSS I/O circuits in a<br /> bank|1.2V/1.5V/1.8V/2.5V/3.3V|
|VDDIx MSS-SGMII<br /> Banks1|Supply for MSS-SGMII circuits in a<br /> bank|2.5V/3.3V|
|VDDIx MSS-DDR Banks1|Supply for MSS-DDR circuits in a<br /> bank|1.2V/1.5V/1.8V|
