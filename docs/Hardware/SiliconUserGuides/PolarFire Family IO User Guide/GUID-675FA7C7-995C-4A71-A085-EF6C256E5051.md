# Differential Transmitter Mode

The I/O buffer pair allows implementing both true differential output mode and pseudo-differential output mode. The true differential output mode uses an LVDS H-bridge-type driver. The pseudo-differential output mode, also known as complementary-mode, consists of two single-ended drivers where one driverâ€™s output is inverted relative to the other. The pseudo-differential output drivers have lower signal integrity and performance, and usually require biasing by external resistors to emulate true differential signal levels. Only GPIO bank supports true differential output modes using a differential current driver. Both GPIO and HSIO banks support complementary output modes.
