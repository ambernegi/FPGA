# LVDS in GPIO Banks with VDDI = 1.8V

LVDS inputs and outputs in the GPIO banks are supported from Libero SoC with VDDI = 1.8V and<br /> VDDAUX= 2.5V or 3.3V. Both LVDS18G inputs and outputs operate from the VDDAUX power supply,<br /> which allows operation independent of the VDDI power supply. LVDS18G inputs include on-chip<br /> differential termination, and true high-speed differential outputs are used in LVDS18G. The<br /> LVDS18G IOSTD is supported only for input and output I/Os \(TRIBUF and INOUT is not supported\).

LVDS18G I/O standard allows Libero SoC to set VDDI = 1.8V, thereby placing other 1.8V I/O on the<br /> bank as mixed voltage support, and simultaneously supporting the LVDS modes \(see respective<br /> [PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-DS00003831.pdf), [PolarFire SoC FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf)\), [RT PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/RT-PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-00004122A.pdf), or [RT PolarFire SoC Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf). If setting the I/O<br /> standards from I/O Editor or PDC with VDDI = 1.8V, it requires the selection of LVDS18G as I/O<br /> TYPE and VDDAUX = 2.5V \(or 3.3V\) circuit board voltage supply. LVDS18G input requires Clamp<br /> Diode to be OFF when placed on a bank with VDDI = 1.8V.
