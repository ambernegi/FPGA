# High-Speed Current Steering Logic \(HCSL\)

HCSL is a differential output standard used in PCI Express applications.<br /> Both GPIO and HSIO support the HCSL I/O standards \(receive-only mode\). Although, the common<br /> mode range for this standard is from 250 mV to 550 mV, HCSL I/O receivers support a wider<br /> range of 50 mV to 2.4V.
