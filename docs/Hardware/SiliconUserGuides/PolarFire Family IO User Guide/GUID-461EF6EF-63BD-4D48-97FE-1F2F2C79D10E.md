# I/O Interface Timing Constraints

Libero SoC is capable of generating SDC timing constraints for design components used in IOD interfaces. These derived SDC constraints are based on the configuration of the IOD blocks including the sub-blocks required for the specific IOD functionality. The derived SDC constraints are placed in the `<root>_derived_constraints.sdc` file.

For static IOD Rx and Tx interfaces, static timing analysis can be performed<br /> using the auto-generated derived constraints. Dynamic IOD Rx interfaces use a training<br /> operation on hardware to adapt the I/O timing to the PCB characteristics. For this, the<br /> derived SDC uses a wider range of delay and which cannot be used to accurately perform<br /> timing analysis of external setup/hold timing of IOD generic Rx when configured in<br /> Dynamic mode.

When using IOD Rx and Tx, use derived constraints for timing and physical constraints.<br /> Based on the timing violations from SmartTime, define the appropriate tap delays<br /> \(IN\_DELAY for IOD Rx and OUT\_DELAY for IOD Tx\) using the **I/O Attribute Editor**,<br /> and use the generated PDC file for Place and Route. Ensure that there are no timing<br /> violations in the SmartTime before programming the device. User must define the tap<br /> delays as required.
