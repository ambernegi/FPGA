# LVPECL Emulated \(LVPECLE33\) Output Mode

LVPECL is derived from ECL and PECL and uses 3.3V supply voltage. The<br /> following illustration shows an example of implementation using 93Ω stub resistors with a<br /> 196Ω parallel/differential termination at the driver and a 100Ω differential termination at<br /> the receiver. The termination values at the driver must be optimized to match the effective<br /> differential impedance of the bus. In this example, the effective parallel differential<br /> termination at the receiver is around 66Ω. However, the series 93Ω resistors are always<br /> seen by the driver yielding an effective differential impedance of 252Ω. The receivers see<br /> an attenuated signal.
