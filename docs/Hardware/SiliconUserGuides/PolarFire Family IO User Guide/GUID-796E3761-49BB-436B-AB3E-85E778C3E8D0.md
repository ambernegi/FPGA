# IOD CDR Clocking

A dedicated CCC is generated by Libero SoC to support IOD CDR interfaces.<br /> PF\_IOD\_CDR\_CCC configurator provides the options to generate the module. The REF\_CLK input<br /> is required based on the Data rate and CCC PLL clock multiplier. The PF\_IOD\_CDR\_CCC does<br /> not allow divider control for the divider generating TX\_CLK\_G because the IOCDR only works<br /> in ratio 5 and is preset by Libero SoC. Libero SoC provides the proper timing constraints<br /> \(as shown\) when derived in the constraints manager.
