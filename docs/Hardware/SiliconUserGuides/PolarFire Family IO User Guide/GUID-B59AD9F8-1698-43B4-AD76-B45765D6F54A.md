# CoreRxIODBitAlign

CoreRxIODBitAlign IP available from the Libero SoC Catalog performs training when interfacing the IOD macro to support as a dynamic source with adjusting delays to capture the data correctly.

**Important:** HS\_IO\_CLK is internal connection.

This CoreRxIODBitAlign IP works based on Fabric clock \(OUT\_FABCLK\*\) from CCC or PLL component and PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX IOD component works based on OUT\*\_HS\_IO\_CLK\_\* or for bit alignment.

An example application for bit alignment uses the PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX IOD<br /> component to receive the serial data with a required data rate of 1000 Mbps in DDRx4 fabric<br /> mode. The OUT2\_FABCLK\_0 know as SCLK is driven from the PLL of the CCC component at 125 MHz<br /> and OUT0\_HS\_IO\_CLK\_0 to PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX at 500 MHz.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP starts the training when the PLL\_LOCK is stable and<br /> driven high. The LP\_IN input is used only in the CoreRxIODBitAlign IP when MIPI\_TRNG parameter<br /> is set to 1. This LP\_IN signaling is active low and level-based, detected as negative edge<br /> every time by the IP to indicate the valid start of frame to start the bit alignment training<br /> mechanism. If MIPI\_TRNG parameter is set to 0, then this input is left unused by the IP.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP indicates the start of training by driving BIT\_ALGN\_START high and BIT\_ALGN\_DONE as low. It then drives the output BIT\_ALGN\_LOAD to load the default settings in the PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX component. The BIT\_ALGN\_CLR\_FLGS is used to clear the IOD\_EARLY, IOD\_LATE and BIT\_ALGN\_OOR flags.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP proceeds with BIT\_ALGN\_MOVE followed with<br /> BIT\_ALGN\_CLR\_FLGS for every TAP and records the IOD\_EARLY,<br /> IOD\_LATE flags. When BIT\_ALGN\_OOR is set high by the<br /> PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX component, then the CoreRxIODBitAlign IP<br /> sweeps the recorded EARLY and LATE flags and finds the optimal<br /> EARLY and LATE flags to calculate the required TAP delays for<br /> clock and data bit alignment. CoreRxIODBitalign IP selects the<br /> window size, which has the best case IOD\_EARLY and IOD\_LATE<br /> flags counts.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP loads the calculated TAP delays and drives BIT\_ALGN\_START low and BIT\_ALGN\_DONE high to indicate the completion of the training.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP continues the Re-training dynamically if it detects noisy IOD\_EARLY or IOD\_LATE feedback assertion from PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX component. The BIT\_ALGN\_DONE is reset and driven low and BIT\_ALGN\_START is driven high again by the CoreRxIODBitAlign IP to indicate the restart of the training. The timeout counter when reaches the timeout condition asserts the BIT\_ALGN\_ERR at the end of the training.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP also provides restart mechanism for the user to restart<br /> the training whenever required. The BIT\_ALGN\_RSTRT<br /> input is active high level must be driven high<br /> \(for example, 8 clocks\). The BIT\_ALGN\_DONE is<br /> reset and driven low. BIT\_ALGN\_START is driven<br /> high again by the CoreRxIODBitAlign IP to indicate<br /> the fresh start of the training.

The CoreRxIODBitAlign IP also provides hold mechanism to hold the training in<br /> the middle. In this use case, the HOLD\_TRNG<br /> parameter must be set to 1 then the<br /> CoreRxIODBitAlign IP uses the BIT\_ALGN\_HOLD input<br /> and asserts active high level-based until it<br /> requires the CoreRxIODBitAlign IP to hold the<br /> training and then continues the training when the<br /> input BIT\_ALGN\_HOLD is driven low.

IOD analysis is available for generic RX IOD interfaces that use the CoreRXIODBITALIGN IP.<br /> SmartDebug includes an utility that can analyze the clock<br /> and data margins of an interface. The utility provides<br /> feedback on the amount of delay taps between lanes to<br /> depict any disparity in PCB routing deviations. See [SmartDebug User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/smartdebug_ug.pdf) for more information.
