# I/O Training

The training logic manages the timing exchanges between the IOD and bit alignment IP \(or DDR controller modules\). I/O training is related to the optimization of source-synchronous timing paths into and out of the device. This stage of training uses elements in the IOD block to perform DYNAMIC or real-time optimization, which analyzes and tunes the required changes in device performance based on device process, temperature, and voltages variations.

IO training utilizes the FPGA hosted logic to handshake to the IOD block \(see [Dynamic Delay Control](GUID-57F1B703-45B4-4461-92AB-0152A550919C.md#GUID-9A2A8921-6B7C-47E1-88D5-C6E2DFC62694)\). The handshaking optimizes the delay elements within the I/O data and clock paths to appropriately adjust the timing relationships to optimize performance.
