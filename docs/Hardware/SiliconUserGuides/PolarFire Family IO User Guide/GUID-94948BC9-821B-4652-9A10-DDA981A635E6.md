# Interface Selection Rules

The following rules apply when assigning a pin to the RX\_DDRX\_B\_G\_FA interfaces:

-   RX\_CLK input must be placed in an I/O with the CCC\_CLKIN\_z\_w function in the same bank as other I/Os. This pin allows connection to the PLL reference clock. For more information about the available pins for each device, see [PolarFire Family Clocking Resources User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/Microchip_PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Clocking_Resources_User_Guide_VB.pdf). Other preferred clock pins are not suited for this connection.
-   RX and RX\_CLK I/Os must be placed in the same bank \(exception on device with bank7, I/Os can be either in both bank0 and bank7\).
-   Interface uses a PLL to generate high-speed clock.
-   One IOD per data I/Os.
-   One IOA per data and clock I/Os.
-   IOA from two different interfaces \(TX/RX/DDR/QDR/OCTAL/IO\_CDR\) cannot be placed in the same I/O lane.
