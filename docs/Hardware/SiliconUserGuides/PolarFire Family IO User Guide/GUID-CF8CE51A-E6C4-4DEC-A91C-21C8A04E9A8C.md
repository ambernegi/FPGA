# I/O Interface Configurators

I/O interface configurators assemble interfaces from the device input and output pins to the fabric. The configurator includes IOD blocks and the connectivity required for the interface. The configurators include tabs that show the configured component with the ports. The receiver configurator includes an interactive waveform diagram that updates the use case based on the inputs to the configurator GUI. The GUI also includes simple design rule checks to prevent from crating modules that are not allowed by the architecture.
