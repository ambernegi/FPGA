# Interface Ports

The following table lists the RX\_DDR\_\[G:R\]\_A interface mode ports.

|Port|I/O|Description|
|----|---|-----------|
|RX|Input|Input DDR data. Supports up to 128-bits for \_G interfaces and 11-bit for \_R interfaces.|
|RX\_CLK|Input|Input DDR clock.|
|L\#\_RX\_DATA\[n:0\]|Output|DDR output to FPGA fabric. ‘n’ equals the output pins from the geared DDR component to the fabric where the even numbered pin is the rising edge data and the odd numbered pin is the falling edge data of the DDR signal. The number of fabric pins are based on the number of I/Os and the gearing ratio.L\# is associated with the \# of external input pins up to 128 maximum.|
|RX\_CLK\_R/ RX\_CLK\_G|Output|Receive clock to FPGA fabric using a global \(G\), regional \(R\) clock.|
|\(1\) Other pins are visible when advanced options are used. See [Generic IOD Interface Implementation](GUID-8222AB9C-2F29-47B9-8E42-AF75F97A64B1.md).| |
