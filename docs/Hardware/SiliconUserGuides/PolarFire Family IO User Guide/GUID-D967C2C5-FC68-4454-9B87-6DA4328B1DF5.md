# Low-Voltage Differential Signal \(LVDS\)

LVDS \(ANSI/TIA/EIA-644\) is a high-speed, differential I/O standard. The voltage<br /> swing between two signal lines is approximately 350 mV. GPIO supports LVDS receive and<br /> transmit modes. HSIO supports LVDS receive mode with an external 100Î© board termination,<br /> see [I/O External Termination](GUID-81AF537E-CBCA-4F12-8617-BC33468205D6.md) for<br /> more information.
