# Mini-LVDS

Mini-LVDS is a unidirectional interface from the timing controller to the column drivers in TFT LCD displays, and is specified in Texas Instruments standard, SLDA007A. GPIO supports mini-LVDS in both receive and transmit modes. HSIO supports mini-LVDS only in the receive mode and requires an external resistor.
