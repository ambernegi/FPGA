# PF\_IOD\_CDR

The PF\_IOD\_CDR interface provides an asynchronous receiver and a transmit<br /> interface for serial data transfers. This interface can support up to 1 GbE transfers.<br /> It supports serial protocols and other similar encoded serial protocols. PF\_IOD\_CDR uses<br /> a 10:1 digital ratio to provide a 10-bit data and clock interface for both transmit and<br /> receive modes. In the receive mode, the clock recovery circuit is used in the lane<br /> controller to generate the recovered clock. The PF\_IOD\_CDR interface is compatible with<br /> CoreTSE, CoreTSE\_AHB, and CoreSGMII configured in TBI mode. For information about<br /> reference design using PF\_IOD\_CDR, see [AN4623: PolarFire FPGA 1G Ethernet Loopback Using IOD CDR \(Earlier DG0799\)](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNotes/PolarFire_FPGA_1G_Ethernet_Loopback_Using_IOD_CDR.pdf).

The following illustration shows the PF\_IOD\_CDR transmit and receive interface.

The IOD\_CDR solutions requires two purposes built IP cores.

-   PF\_IOD\_CDR
-   PF \_IOD\_CDR\_CCC

These two cores permit master and slave sharing. A BIF is available to connect the clock outputs from PF\_IOD CDR CCC to PF\_IOD CDR.
