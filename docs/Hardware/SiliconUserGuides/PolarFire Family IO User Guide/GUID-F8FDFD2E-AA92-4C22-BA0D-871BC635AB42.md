# Lane Clock Resources

Each lane has several clock networks in the I/O lane. The lane clock resources are distributed from each lane controller to each of the 12 IODs within a lane. The lane clock resource is not controllable as Libero SoC automatically uses the lane clock resource based on the I/O configuration.
