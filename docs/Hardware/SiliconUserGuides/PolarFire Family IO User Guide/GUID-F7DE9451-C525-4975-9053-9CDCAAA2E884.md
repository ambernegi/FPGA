# I/O FIFO

The IOD block contains an I/O FIFO for phase compensation clock domain transfers. In DDR applications, the I/O FIFO is used for high-speed transfer data from the external DQS domain to the internal data clock domain. Libero SoC and Microchip memory controller cores configure the I/O FIFO based on the application settings.
