# Interface Selection Rules

The following rules apply when assigning a pin to the RX\_DDR\_G\_A aligned interface:

-   Up to 12 single-ended data I/O and six differential data I/O.
-   RX\_CLK input must be placed in an I/O with the CLKIN\_z\_w function in the same bank as other I/Os.
-   One IOD per data I/Os.
-   One IOA per data and clock I/Os.
-   RX IOA can be freely placed.

The following rules apply when assigning a pin to the RX\_DDR\_R\_A aligned<br /> interface:

-   Up to 11 single-ended data I/O and five differential data I/O.
-   Uses one LANECTRL to connect to regional clock.
-   Uses one regional clock.
-   RX and RX\_CLK I/Os must be placed in the same I/O lane.
-   RX\_CLK input must be placed in the P side I/O with the DQS function in the lane.
-   RX and RX\_CLK I/Os must be placed in the same bank \(RX and RX\_CLK I/O pins can be shared across banks 0 and 7\).
-   One IOD per data I/Os.
-   One IOA per data and clock I/Os.
