# Interface Ports

The following table lists the RX\_DDRX\_B\_G\_DYN/ RX\_DDRX\_B\_R\_DYN interface mode ports.

|Port|I/O|Description|
|----|---|-----------|
|RXD/RXD\_N|Input|Differential input DDR data|
|RX\_CLK\_P/RX\_CLK\_N|Input|Differential input clock|
|ARST\_N|Input|Asynchronous reset to IOD and lane controller. Asserting ARST\_N<br /> to the TX/RX IODs also resets any updated delay values set by dynamic<br /> training. ARST\_N does not reset any static clock training values. When<br /> using dynamic IOD training, it falls back to zero delay taps after<br /> ARST\_N is toggled and it is expected to be retrained. It does not revert<br /> to any initial static setting. Only static IOD configurations fall back<br /> to the initial static value found in PDC when reset.|
|Lx\_BIT\_SLIP|Input|Bit slip input \(per lane\) from fabric is initiated by a rising edge of the slip signal from the core fabric. Lx\_BIT\_SLIP is not available for DDRX3.5 gearing.|
|Lx\_RXD\_DATA\[m:0\]|Output|DDR output to FPGA fabric, value depends on digital ratio|
|RX\_CLK\_R/RX\_CLK\_G|Output|Receive clock to FPGA fabric using a global \(G\) or regional \(R\) clock.|
|CLK\_TRAIN\_DONE|Output|Indicates HS\_IO\_CLK and system clock training is complete. See [HS\_IO\_CLK and System Clock Training](GUID-189BB03C-9B39-4920-A246-87AA79EAB04F.md).|
|CLK\_TRAIN\_ERROR|Output|Indicates HS\_IO\_CLK and system clock training did not complete. See [HS\_IO\_CLK and System Clock Training](GUID-189BB03C-9B39-4920-A246-87AA79EAB04F.md).|

The RX\_DDRX\_B\_G\_DYN/ RX\_DDRX\_B\_R\_DYN interface has bit slip input from fabric, called Lx\_BIT\_SLIP. The slip input pin is used for word alignment. The slip function is used in 2, 4, and 5 Digital Modes—slip 1 bit at a time.
