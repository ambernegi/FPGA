# Transceiver Receivers, Transmitters, and Reference Clock Inputs

For information about Transceiver \(XCVR\) input receivers and output<br /> transmitters, see [PolarFire Family Transceiver User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Transceiver_User_Guide_VB.pdf).

Reference Clock \(REF\_CLK\) Inputs dedicated to transceivers are similar to FPGA<br /> GPIO. However, some features and capabilities do differ. For information, see [PolarFire Family Transceiver User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Transceiver_User_Guide_VB.pdf).
