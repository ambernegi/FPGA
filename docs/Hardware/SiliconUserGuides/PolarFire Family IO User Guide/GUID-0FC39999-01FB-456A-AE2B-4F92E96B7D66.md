# Stub Series Terminated Logic \(SSTL\)

SSTL is a general-purpose memory bus standard. Following are the SSTL operational modes supported:

-   SSTL25I—SSTL Class I-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 2.5V
-   SSTL25II—SSTL Class II-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 2.5V
-   SSTL18I—SSTL Class I-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 1.8V
-   SSTL18II—SSTL Class II-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 1.8V
-   SSTL15I—SSTL Class I-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 1.5V
-   SSTL15II—SSTL Class II-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 1.5V
-   SSTL135I—SSTL Class I-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 1.35V
-   SSTL135II—SSTL Class II-standard with VDDI \(nominal\) = 1.35V

SSTL25 is defined by the JEDEC standard, JESD8-9B, and used for DDR SDRAM and DDR1 memory interfaces. SSTL18 is defined by the JEDEC standard, JESD8, and used for DDR2 SDRAM memory interfaces. SSTL15 is used for DDR3 memory interfaces; SSTL135 is used for DDR3L memory interfaces.
