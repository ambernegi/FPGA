# Differential Near End Termination

Programmable output termination is provided for many differential output types. By default, applications with differential signaling is terminated at the receiver \(or far-end\). However, near-end or source termination can be used to improve signal integrity in lossy connections.

|I/O<br /> Standard|Values|
|--------------------------------|------|
|LVDS18G,<br /> LVDS25, LVDS33, MINILVDS25, MINILVDS33, LCMDS33,<br /> LCMDS25, PPDS25, PPDS33, RSDS25, RSDS33,<br /> SUBLVDS25, SUBLVDS331|OFF, 100.<br /> \(Default = OFF\)|

The source termination values can be programmed by using the I/O attribute editor in Libero SoC or by using the following PDC command:

`set_io â€“SOURCE_TERM <value>`

**Important:** Source termination is required for 1600 Mbps/800 MHz clock.
