# Clock Sharing

The same PLL is shared between the PF\_IOD\_CDR receive and transmit<br /> interfaces, as shown in [Figure â€€ 1](#GUID-6E8A1F77-D7F5-462E-A10A-22E790E77006). In addition, multiple PF\_IOD\_CDR interfaces can share the same PLL on<br /> the adjacent vertical and horizontal edges. For instance, the PLL\_SW\_0 interface can drive<br /> the PF\_IOD\_CDR interface on the southern and western edges \(see [PolarFire Family I/O Banks](GUID-015DB00F-F8A2-4F67-8937-A0AC6FACC841.md)\).

The following illustration shows multiple PF\_IOD\_CDR transmit and receive interfaces.
