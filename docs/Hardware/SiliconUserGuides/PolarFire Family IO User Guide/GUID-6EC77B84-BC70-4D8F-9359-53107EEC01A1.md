# MSS DDR VREF \(PolarFire SoC and RT PolarFire SoC Only\)

Bank 6 is unique as it has two internal VREF generators. These VREF generators<br /> have separate and different VREFs, one for the CA bus and the other for the DQ bus. When<br /> both VREFs are used internally, the values are same, which is 50% of VDDI for that bank.<br /> Typically, both VREFs are internal and the same. It may be desirable to provide external<br /> VREF for DQ depending on terminations, or simply having the ability to monitor that<br /> voltage.
