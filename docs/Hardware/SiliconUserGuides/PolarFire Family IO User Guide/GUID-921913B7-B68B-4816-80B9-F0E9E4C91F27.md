# Differential Receiver Mode

Both GPIO and HSIO receivers support operations in differential receiver mode, where the input data from the differential pair of pads \(PAD P and PAD N\) is received on both pads and is then driven to the FPGA fabric from the IOD block on the P side.

LiberoÂ® SoC controls the enabling and disabling of the transmit and receive buffer based upon the selected standard and I/O mode, whether single-ended or differential. For more information about IOA buffer and its use model, see [I/O Features and Implementation, page 15](trunk_Merge_IO_UG/user_io_chapter_2.fm#28880%20ChapterTitle%20UN%20SmartFusion2%20SoC%20FPGA%20-%20In-System%20Programming%20Using%20UART%20Interface%20Demo).
