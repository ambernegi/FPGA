# Implementing Emulated Standards for Outputs

External terminations are required to implement SLVSE, BLVDSE, MLVDSE, and LVPECLE output modes. These outputs, referred to as emulated differential outputs, are noted in [Table â€€ 1](GUID-F70058C5-84DC-4CC4-970B-ACE6DD487352.md#ID-0000229D).

Emulated differential standards use compensated push-pull drivers in<br /> complementary output mode and require external terminations on the board to match the<br /> common-mode and voltage swing to meet the I/O signal standards. PCB design practices<br /> must account for the effective impedance of the entire connection including the bus<br /> trace characteristic impedance Zo and the capacitive loading. This section provides<br /> example implementations for the emulated standards.
