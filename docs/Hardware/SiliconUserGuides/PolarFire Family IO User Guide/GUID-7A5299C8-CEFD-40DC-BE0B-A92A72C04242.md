# Interface Selection Rules

Follow these rules when assigning a pin for the PF\_IOD\_CDR interface:

-   One differential input IOA, one differential output IOA.
-   Four IOD associated with IOA, one floating IOD.
-   The floating IOD is placed in the N side IOD site with the function DQS.
-   N side IOA with the function DQS cannot be used.
-   One PF\_IOD\_CDR\_CCC can be shared with multiple instances of PF\_IOD\_CDR as long as they are at the same data rate and placed in the same group of lanes.
-   PF\_IOD\_CDR\_CCC uses one PLL, one DLL and one LANECTRL.
-   Transmit and receive IOA must be placed in the same lane.
-   IOA from two different interfaces \(TX/RX/DDR/QDR/OCTAL/CDR\) cannot be placed in the same I/O lane.
