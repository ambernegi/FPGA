# I/O Glitches

I/O glitches can occur at power up or power down. The conditions that cause the<br /> glitches depend on the use of GPIO or HSIO in the system. The dependencies of VDD, VDDI, and<br /> VDDAUX to mitigate any glitches on the I/O interfaces are discussed in respective [PolarFire FPGA Board Design User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_FPGA_Board_Design_UG0726_V11.pdf) or [PolarFire SoC FPGA Board Design Guidelines User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Board_Design_Guidelines_User_Guide_VB.pdf).
