# Multipoint Low-Voltage Emulated \(MLVDSE25\) Output Mode

MLVDS has larger signaling amplitude when compared to BLVDS, and therefore, it<br /> requires more drive current. Similar to BLVDS, the effective impedance of these systems<br /> is lower than a typical pair of PCB traces due to backplane capacitance, the connectors<br /> on the backplane, and the line stubs. The following illustration shows an example<br /> implementation using 35立 stub resistors at every drop and 50立 stub resistors on either<br /> side of the bus. The termination values at the ends of the bus, which can range anywhere<br /> between 50立 and 70立, must be optimized to match the effective differential impedance of<br /> the bus.
