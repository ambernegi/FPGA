# CoreBclkSclkAlign Training IP

The CoreBclkSclkAlign training IP is provided with IOD blocks to optimize the performance of the<br /> interfaces. This must be instantiated for all Generic IOD Rx and Tx interfaces above 400<br /> Mbps with x2, x3.5, and x4 ratios. The IP is specifically intended for clock alignment<br /> by using the ICB or PLL VCOPHSEL controls to move the BCLK \(HS\_IO\_CLK\) in the PLL in<br /> reference to SCLK \(system or fabric clock\).

When creating generic IOD interfaces, the CoreBclkSclkAlign IP component is included in<br /> the generated core of the IOD Generic Transmit Interface Clocking IP \(PF\_IOD\_TX\_CCC\) as<br /> well as the IOD Generic Receive Interface IP \(PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX\). Both of these<br /> fabric-hosted soft IP components include the CoreBclkSclkAlign, which is instantiated by<br /> Libero SoC during IOD configuration process for the purpose of calibrating and training<br /> the I/O gearing elements for the use of high-speed interfaces.
