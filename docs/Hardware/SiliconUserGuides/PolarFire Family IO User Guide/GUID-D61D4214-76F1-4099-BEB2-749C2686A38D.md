# Latency

The latency listed in the following table is an approximation and based on a specific fixed relationship for HSIO\_CLKS clocks and regional clocks. Due to the flexibility and training associated with the DDR interfaces, the latency can be different than that listed by Â±1 cycle.

|IOD Mode|Direction|Latency Cycle \(Rx/Tx CLK\)|
|--------|---------|---------------------------|
|RX\_DDRX1|Input|1|
|RX\_DDRX2|Input|4|
|RX\_DDRX3P5|Input|6|
|RX\_DDRX4|Input|7|
|RX\_DDRX5|Input|9|
|TX\_DDRX1|Output|2.5|
|TX\_DDRX2|Output|5.5|
|TX\_DDRX3P5|Output|6|
|TX\_DDRX4|Output|10.5|
|TX\_DDRX5|Output|13.5|
