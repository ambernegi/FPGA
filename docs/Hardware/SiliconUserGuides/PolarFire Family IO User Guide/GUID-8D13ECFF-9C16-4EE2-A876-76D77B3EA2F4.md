# MIPI D-PHY Transmit Interface \(High-Speed Only\) with Bidirectional Low-Power Mode

GPIO also supports a bidirectional MIPI D-PHY lane with external resistors, as shown in the following illustration. Microchip provides a macro that can be instantiated in the user design to implement the MIPI transmit interface \(high-speed only\) with bidirectional low-power mode, see [Generic I/O Interfaces](GUID-A63099D1-2595-43B7-B69C-1ABB1F7E412A.md) for more information.
