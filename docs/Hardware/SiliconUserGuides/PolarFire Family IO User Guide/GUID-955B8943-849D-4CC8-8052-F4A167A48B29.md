# IOD Block Overview

The IOD block includes the input and output delay functions, I/O<br /> registers, and digital logic blocks. The digital logic blocks are receive digital \(Rx<br /> digital\) for input, transmit digital \(Tx digital\) for output, and enable digital \(OE<br /> digital\) for the enable signals. The IOD block also includes several high-speed, low-skew<br /> clock networks. [Figure â€€ 1](#GUID-91275C22-1434-42D9-9D15-4C688EF76796) shows an overview of the IOD block. Various I/O features are set mainly<br /> by the protocol configurator or the Libero SoC configurator within Libero SoC. However,<br /> some of the I/O features such as I/O register and programmable delay can be controlled<br /> automatically or manually by Libero SoC.

The following illustration shows an overview of the IOD block.

**Note:** The values of M and N depend on the digital ratio. Enable path delay is not customizable by the user design.
