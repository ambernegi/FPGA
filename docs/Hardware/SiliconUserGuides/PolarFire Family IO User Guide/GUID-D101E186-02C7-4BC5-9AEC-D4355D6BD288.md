# IOD Templates

Many IOD templates are available for ease entry of interface settings. The interfaces \(see [Generic I/O Interfaces](GUID-A63099D1-2595-43B7-B69C-1ABB1F7E412A.md)\) are captured by the templates. Select a desired preset in the left pane and right-click. Click **Apply** to load the related interface configuration to the GUI. Click **View** to see the specific configuration settings. When applied, the templates auto-fills the Configuration settings within the tab for the applied template. This is a simple method of applying legal combinations for IOD configurations. Modify according to specific requirement. It also navigates the user to use the available configurations.
