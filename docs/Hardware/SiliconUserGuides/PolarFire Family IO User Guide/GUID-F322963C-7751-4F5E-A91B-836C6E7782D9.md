# Open Drain GPIO

GPIO can be used to create an open-drain output when VDDI is below the required<br /> high output level. In this case, the GPIO pin only drives a LOW output. When not driving<br /> LOW, it is externally pulled up to a maximum of 3.3V through an external 200Ω pull-up<br /> resistor. This is accomplished by selecting the CLAMP = OFF and the internal RES\_PULL =<br /> NONE. The actual voltage at the PAD output will be lower than 3.3V, depending on the<br /> value of the pull-up resistor. The user must drive the enable pin of the tristate buffer<br /> through an inverter to reflect the user logic High at the PAD Output.

**Important:** External pull-up values of 250Ω are suggested up to 33 MHz operations. 200Ω pull-up is suggested for up to 50 MHz. The external pull-up resistor acts as a voltage divider between 3.3V and the bank VDDI. Based on the pull-up resistor value and bank VDDI chosen, the PAD output voltage will accordingly be lower than 3.3V.
