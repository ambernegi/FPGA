# Unused I/O Pins

In application designs not using specific I/O pins, the unused programming of<br /> these I/O pins are managed by Libero SoC. Designers can refer to the PPAT spreadsheets<br /> to determine the default programming of unused I/O by Libero SoC. Other recommendations<br /> for unused pins such as power pins and special function pins are defined in the<br /> respective [PolarFire FPGA Board Design User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_FPGA_Board_Design_UG0726_V11.pdf) or [PolarFire SoC FPGA Board Design Guidelines User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Board_Design_Guidelines_User_Guide_VB.pdf).
