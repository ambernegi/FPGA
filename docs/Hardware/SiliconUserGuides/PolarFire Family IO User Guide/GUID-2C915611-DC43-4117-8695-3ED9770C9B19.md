# Receive Interface

The PF\_IOD\_CDR receive interface uses four high-speed bank clocks and generates the recovered clock. The lane controller in the IOD includes a clock recovery block. It uses the incoming data and the four bank clocks and generates RX\_CLK\_R, also known as DIVCLK. The downstream IP or logic uses this clock. The serial data is received on an IOA pair and sent to the associated IOD block. The IOD block uses a 10:1 digital ratio. The IOD block uses the recovered clock to capture the serial data stream to the core.

The CDR requires four phases of the HS\_IO\_CLK running at half the frequency of the serial data rate. The RX\_CLK\_R into the fabric includes jitter from the switching of the phase, which creates this clock.
