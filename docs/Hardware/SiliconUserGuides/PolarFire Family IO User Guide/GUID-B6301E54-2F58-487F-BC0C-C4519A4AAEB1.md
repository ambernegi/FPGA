# Static Timing Analysis

Static delays are automatically prescribed by the IOD configurator. The values<br /> that are added based on the IOD configuration can be found in the<br /> `boardlayout.xml` report shown in the following figure. These are the<br /> initial values set by the software based on initial IOD setup information. The settings<br /> can be modified as mentioned in the preceding section with pdc or IOEditor. You can<br /> adjust the delay values by adding or subtracting from the initial value applied in the<br /> Libero SoC configurations. The per tap incremental delay value is found in the<br /> respective [PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-DS00003831.pdf) or [PolarFire SoC Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf).
