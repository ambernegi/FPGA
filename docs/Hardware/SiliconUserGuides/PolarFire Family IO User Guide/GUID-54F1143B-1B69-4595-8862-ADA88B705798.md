# Slew Rate Control

GPIO supports slew rate control in non-differential output mode. In I/O Editor<br /> or the PDC file, when SLEW is set to ON, the device uses a limited slew rate for the I/O<br /> standard in the device. In I/O Editor or the PDC file, when SLEW is set to OFF, the<br /> device uses the fastest slew rate for the I/O standard. The impacts to Simultaneous<br /> Switching Noise \(SSN\) can be reduced by using the SLEW set to ON. However, this reduces<br /> the maximum rate of change of the output signal that can influence switching<br /> performance.

The following table lists the I/O standards that support slew rate control.

|I/O Standards|Supported I/O Type|Options|
|-------------|------------------|-------|
|PCI|GPIO \(output only\)|ON \(default\),OFF|
|LVTTL|GPIO \(output only\)|ON \(default\),OFF|
|LVCMOS25 and LVCMOS33|GPIO \(output only\)|ON \(default\),OFF|

Slew rate settings are controlled using the I/O attribute editor in Libero SoC,<br /> or by using the following PDC command:

``` {#ID-00002260}
set_io â€“SLEW <value>
```

The value can be set as ON or OFF.

Slew rate control is not available in HSIO buffers. However, these buffers have built-in PVT-compensated slew rate controllers for optimized signal integrity.
