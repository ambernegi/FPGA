# Device Programming Modes

The following table lists the user I/O states during various programming modes.<br /> For more information about programming modes, see [PolarFire FPGA and PolarFire SoC FPGA Programming User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Programming_User_Guide_VB.pdf) or [RT PolarFire FPGA Programming User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/RT_PolarFire_FPGA_Programming_User_Guide_VB.pdf).

|Programming<br /> Modes|I/O<br /> States|
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|JTAG|Set during<br /> JTAG programming in Libero SoC|
|SPI slave<br /> programming|Weakly pulled<br /> up by default \(no user control\)|
|IAP|Tri-state<br /> with weak pull-up/pull-down|
|Auto-programming|Tri-state|
|IAP<br /> recovery|Tri-state<br /> with weak pull-up/pull-down|
