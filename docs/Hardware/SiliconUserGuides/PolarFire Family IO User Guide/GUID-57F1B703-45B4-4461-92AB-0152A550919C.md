# Dynamic Delay Control

Dynamic receiver delay controls are exposed on the IOD component by enabling it<br /> in the IOD configurator. On the IOD configurator -&gt; **Advanced** \(tab\)<br /> -&gt; **Debug** \(pane\), select the **Expose dynamic delay control**<br /> checkbox to add ports as shown in [Figure   2](GUID-70A2AF8E-A06D-4A0E-8D99-02A9F2783D1E.md#GUID-C817C4E5-F68B-4FAC-B7DE-5B5E6ED2883C). These ports are automatically exposed when<br /> selecting any of the RX\_DDRX\_DYNAMIC interfaces.

|Port|I/O|Description|
|----|---|-----------|
|DELAY\_LINE\_MOVE[1](#SUP_XTC_PNF_SFC)|Input|Change delay setting on rising edge|
|DELAY\_LINE\_DIRECTION[1](#SUP_XTC_PNF_SFC)|Input|Direction of delay setting change|
|DELAY\_LINE\_LOAD|Input|Asyn. Reload flash settings for delay|
|DELAY\_LINE\_OUT\_OF\_ RANGE|Output|Delay setting has reached max or min range.The delay\_line\_load signal asynchronously reloads the initial static flash bit delay settings.The delay\_line\_move signal is a pulse and changes the delay setting by ±1 increment each time it is pulsed according to the delay\_line\_direction signal value.“1” increases up the delay setting by one increment“0” decreases down the delay setting by one incrementWhen the delay setting reaches the minimum value or the maximum value of the delay chain, the delay chain controller generates an delay\_line\_out\_of\_range output to indicate that it has reached the end of the delay chain. The delay setting stops at this min or max setting, even if the delay\_line\_move signal is still pulsing.|
|EYE\_MONITOR\_EARLY\[n:0\]|Output|The EYE\_MONITOR\_EARLY asserts if the data edge is close to the clock edge on the early side of clock. This flag indicates that the delay settings must be moved down.|
|EYE\_MONITOR\_LATE\[n:0\]|Output|The EYE\_MONITOR\_LATE asserts if the data edge is close to the clock edge on the late side of clock. This flag indicates that the delay setting must be moved up.|
|EYE\_MONITOR\_CLEAR\_ FLAGS\[n:0\]|Input|Use the EYE\_MONITOR\_CLEAR\_FLAGS input signal to clear the “early” and “late” flags. This signal is from the fabric and indicates that the delay chain settings is incremented or decremented as a function of the previous flag settings.|
|EYE\_MONITOR\_WIDTH\[2:0\]|Input|Use the input signals “EYE\_MONITOR\_WIDTH&lt;2:0&gt;” to programably set a minimum delay space requirement between the data edges and the clock edges. The programmable delay settings are programmed in delay increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8. This delay setting is between the clock edge and the data edge. This delay setting is then used to generate flags if the data edges are closer to the clock edges than the minimum setting. By allowing these signals to be dynamically controlled from the core, you can determine the relative size of the eye opening.|
|1The DELAY\_LINE\_MOVE<br /> and DELAY\_LINE\_DIRECTION ports must not be<br /> asserted at the same time or in the same<br /> clock.|

**Important:** EYE\_MONITOR\_\* ports are not available for RX\_DDR interfaces with a gearing ratio of 1.

For statically delayed RX\_DDR\_G\_A/C interfaces, using static IOD delay tap values<br /> instead of using dynamic IOD interface training, the<br /> **Advanced** tab of the IOD configurator allows<br /> to enter a programmable input delay on the input clock. The programmable<br /> delay for the input data signals can be specified in the Libero SoC I/O<br /> Editor or in a user I/O `.pdc` constraints file. However,<br /> note that whenever the **Expose Dynamic Delay Control**<br /> setting is enabled in the IOD configurator, the corresponding programmable<br /> I/O delay tap for the data inputs is set to 1 by default. This applies to<br /> all cores using dynamic IOD delay controls such as Generic IOD TX/RX, DDR<br /> memory, QDR memory, Octal SPI Flash PHY, and so on. Exposing the dynamic<br /> delay controls also prevents from specifying programming input delay values<br /> using the I/O Editor or a user `.pdc` I/O constraint file. In<br /> other words, adding IOD data programmable input delay taps in the I/O Editor<br /> or user `.pdc` constraints is only allowed for statically<br /> delayed IODs where the entire dynamic control interface \(DELAY\_LINE\_\* ports\)<br /> is disabled.
