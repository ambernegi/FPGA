# Shield

Shield IOTYPE are provided for “soft ground” pins to improve the localized<br /> references. These are actual I/O pins that are re-purposed to<br /> isolate switching noises around high-speed I/O interfaces.<br /> Shields are only implemented on memory interfaces on the unused<br /> DQ bits in specific device/package combinations. This rule<br /> applies to GPIO and HSIO based DDRx memory interfaces. For<br /> maximum shielding benefit, it is recommended to tie these SHIELD<br /> signals to VSS on the board for the specific device/packages<br /> included in the PPAT description. This pin function is only<br /> available when using PolarFire family Memory Controllers. For<br /> those combinations that do have Shield pins defined, Libero<br /> enforces to use specific pins as Shields. If Shields are<br /> identified in the PPAT and Libero SoC software, it is<br /> recommended to connect them to GND on the PCB as specified.
