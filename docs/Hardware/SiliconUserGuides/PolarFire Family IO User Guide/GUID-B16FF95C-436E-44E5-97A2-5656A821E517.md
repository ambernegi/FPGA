# Interface Selection Rules

The following conditions are applicable when assigning pins to the TX\_DDR\_G\_A interface:

-   TX and TX\_CLK I/Os are freely placed. The TX data and TX\_CLK skew is equal to the global clock network.
-   One IOD per data and clock I/Os.
-   One IOA per data and clock I/Os.

**Note:** At least, one CCC/PLL is required for clock phasing.

An optional feature enables the transmit parallel clock to be sent out synchronously with<br /> data. This feature is useful for applications such as CameraLink. The option is found in<br /> the Advance tab of the TX\_DDR configurator GUI &gt; Misc section &gt; Enable user control of<br /> clock pattern. The generated TX\_DDR component has a port PF\_IOD\_TX\_CLK:TX\_DATA\_0 that is<br /> in the module with the TX\_CLK\_DATA ports.
