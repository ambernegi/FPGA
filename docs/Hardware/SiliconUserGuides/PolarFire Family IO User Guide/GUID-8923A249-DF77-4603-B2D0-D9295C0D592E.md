# Input DELAY

The DELAY block is used to delay the input data from the input pin to the Input register \(IREG\). It adjusts among the input data bus for any skews. The data input to this block can be delayed using:

-   Static—these are pre-determined delay values \(for Zero Hold time, delay based on Interface Type\) set by the Libero SoC software.
-   DYNAMIC—uses the calibrated codes from DLL of the CCC to maintain correct timing across the system.
-   Dynamic/Training IP \(TIP\)—the data input to this block can also be dynamically updated using Dynamic Delay controls connected to fabric IP logic. See [Dynamic Delay Control](GUID-57F1B703-45B4-4461-92AB-0152A550919C.md).

The DELAY can be adjusted through Libero SoC. This can be done using physical design constraints \(PDC\) or the IOEditor GUI. The DELAY has 256 setting taps that can be adjusted to match the physical connections on the PCB. The PDC values over writes the static settings that are configured by Libero SoC defaults.
