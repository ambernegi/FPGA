The following is a summary of the changes made in this revision:-   Updated [Slew Rate Control](GUID-54F1143B-1B69-4595-8862-ADA88B705798.md) as follows:
    -   Changed the following sentence

"Turning the slew rate on results to faster slew rate improves the available timing margin."

to

"In I/O Editor or the PDC file, when SLEW set to ON, the device uses a limited slew rate for the I/O standard in the device."

    -   Changed the following sentence

"When slew rate is turned OFF, the device uses the default slew rate to reduce the impact of simultaneous switching noise \(SSN\)."

to

"In I/O Editor or the PDC file, when SLEW set to OFF, the device uses the fastest slew rate for the I/O standard. The impacts to Simultaneous Switching Noise \(SSN\) can be reduced by using the SLEW set to ON. However, this reduces the maximum rate of change of the output signal that can influence switching performance."

    -   Removed the reference to the datasheet.
-   Added a sentence in [Open Drain GPIO](GUID-F322963C-7751-4F5E-A91B-836C6E7782D9.md) to describe that the actual voltage at the PAD Output will be lower than 3.3V depending on the value of the pull-up resistor when the GPIO pin is not driving LOW.
