# SGMII I/O

SGMII I/O are provided for a PHY interface in Bank5 \(MSS\_SGMII\). These pins are configured to the<br /> proper differential input and output standards for the dedicated interconnection to the<br /> Ethernet MACs hosted by the MSS block. There are also two I/Os for an external reference<br /> clock source inputs \(MSS\_REFCLK\).

The following table lists the MSS\_SGMII Tx options.

|Tx I/O Standard|Drive \(mA\)|Resistor Pull Mode 1|SOURCE\_TERM|VDDI|
|---------------|------------|--------------------|------------|----|
|LVDS25/33|6, 4, 3.5, 3|None, Up, Down|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|RSDS25/33|4, 3, 2, 1.5|None, Up, Down|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|MINILVDS25/33|6, 4, 3.5, 3|None, Up, Down|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|SUBLVDS25/33|3, 2, 1.5|None, Up, Down|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|PPDS25/33|4, 3, 2, 1.5|None, Up, Down|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|LCMDS25/33|6, 4, 3.5, 3|None, Up, Down|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|1 Optional pull-up/pull-down<br /> resistors may interfere with signal integrity. Users must simulate LVDS<br /> communications if using pull-up/pull-down options.|

The following table lists the MSS\_SGMII Rx Options available in the MSS Configurator.

|Rx I/O Standard|Pull Mode|VCM\_RANGE|ODT|VDDI|
|---------------|---------|----------|---|----|
|LVDS25/33|None, Up, Down|MID, LOW|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|RSDS25/33|None, Up, Down|MID, LOW|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|MINILVDS25/33|None, Up, Down|MID, LOW|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|SUBLVDS25/33|None, Up, Down|MID, LOW|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|PPDS25/33|None, Up, Down|MID, LOW|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
|LCMDS25/33|None, Up, Down|MID, LOW|OFF, 100|2.5V, 3.3V|
