# PLL-Based Coarse Training Method

The coarse training uses the PLL VCOPHSEL controls to move the BCLK in the PLL in reference to<br /> SCLK. This trains both BCLK and BCLK90 by tying the phase select signals for both BCLK<br /> and BCLK90 together. For the training feedback, it uses one spare IOD RX gearbox that<br /> uses SCLK as the data pin and BCLK90 as the clock pin. This training is used to control<br /> the timing relationships between SCLK and BCLK90 for both RX and TX domains. This is<br /> required to reliably and deterministically transfer data across the I/O Gearing to the<br /> fabric interface. The objective is to set BCLK90 to follow SCLK by 90 degrees to define<br /> a known clock domain relationship. HS\_IO\_CLK\_PAUSE to the IOD is asserted at the end of<br /> the clock training routine.
