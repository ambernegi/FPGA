# Low-Voltage CMOS \(LVCMOS\)

LVCMOS is a general-purpose standard implemented in CMOS transistors. Five different LVCMOS operational modes supported are:

-   LVCMOS33—an extension of the LVCMOS standard \(JESD8-B-compliant\) is used for  general-purpose 3.3V applications.
-   LVCMOS25—an extension of the LVCMOS standard \(JESD8-5-compliant\) is used for  general-purpose 2.5V applications.
-   LVCMOS18—an extension of the LVCMOS standard \(JESD8-7-compliant\) is used for  general-purpose 1.8V applications.
-   LVCMOS15—an extension of the LVCMOS standard \(JESD8-11-compliant\) is used for  general-purpose 1.5V applications.
-   LVCMOS12—an extension of the LVCMOS standard \(JESD8-26-compliant\) is used for  general-purpose 1.2V applications.
