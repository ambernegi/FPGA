# Scalable Low-Voltage Signaling Emulated \(SLVSE15\) Output Mode

GPIO and HSIO support SLVS transmitter with external terminations. The<br /> following illustration shows an example of SLVSE implementation. This implementation<br /> requires 100Ω, 82Ω, and 18Ω external termination. Additionally, all driver output levels in<br /> the implementation are level-shifted by approximately 18%.
