# Input Register \(IREG\)

The Input IREG gearing logic data path uses three sets of registers:

-   Shift register
-   Update register
-   Transfer register

The purpose of these registers is to implement Input gearing,<br /> de-serialization of the high-speed pad signals to lower speed parallel core signals, and<br /> the clock domain transfers, as required for the specific interface standard.
