# Global Clock Resource

Each IOD has two global clock inputs from the fabric: one for the receive block \(Receive IOD\) and the other for the transmit block \(Transmit IOD and Enable IOD\). Libero SoC automatically routes the clock signals through the global clock network and connects to the two global clock inputs of the IOD block, if they are driven from the specified resources. The global clock network can be driven by any of the following:

-   Preferred clock inputs \(CLKIN\_z\_w\)
-   Oscillator clocks
-   CCC \(PLL/DLL\)
-   Fabric routing
-   Clock dividers
-   NGMUXs
-   Transceiver reference clock inputs
