# Regional Clock Networks

The regional clock networks are low-latency networks. They can only distribute<br /> clocks to a certain area of the device with low skew. They can be driven from the<br /> divided CDR clock and the divided high-speed IO clock. PolarFire FPGAs and PolarFire SoC<br /> FPGAs offer one regional clock buffer per I/O lane on the northern, southern, and<br /> western edges. The size of the region depends on the regional clock buffer location and<br /> does not overlap. For more information about regional lock buffer location, see [PolarFire Family Clocking Resources User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/Microchip_PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Clocking_Resources_User_Guide_VB.pdf).
