# IOD Features and User Modes

Each I/O \(both GPIO and HSIO\) has a digital block, called IOD, that interfaces with the FPGA fabric on one side and the IOA buffers on the other side \([Figure â€€ 1](GUID-955B8943-849D-4CC8-8052-F4A167A48B29.md#GUID-91275C22-1434-42D9-9D15-4C688EF76796)\). The IOD block includes several digital features, including I/O digital. The I/O digital allows for easy data transfer between the high-speed IOA buffers and the lower-speed FPGA core.

The IOD block can be configured for both input and output SDR and DDR modes. It also allows the gearing-up of the output data rate and gearing-down of the input data rate. These options are configured in Libero SoC and are used to build source synchronous I/O interfaces such as DDR and QDR memory controllers, common interfaces such as RGMII, MIPI D-PHY, 7:1 Video LVDS, and several other non-memory user interfaces.

This chapter provides information about the IOD block and the various I/O user modes, including various SDR, DDR, and digital modes.
