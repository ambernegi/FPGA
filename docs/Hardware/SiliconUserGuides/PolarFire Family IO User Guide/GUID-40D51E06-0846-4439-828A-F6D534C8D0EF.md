# Low-Voltage Positive Emitter-Coupled Logic \(LVPECL\)

LVPECL is a 3.3V differential signal standard that transmits one data bit<br /> over a pair of signal lines, thus requiring two pins per input or output. The voltage swing<br /> between the two signal lines is approximately 850 mV. While LVPECL input is supported for<br /> GPIO, external board termination is required for the LVPECL outputs. For more information<br /> about LVPECL33, see [LVPECL Emulated \(LVPECLE33\) Output Mode](GUID-5F113C5B-E110-4E85-BB95-0DEACB6E53F3.md).
