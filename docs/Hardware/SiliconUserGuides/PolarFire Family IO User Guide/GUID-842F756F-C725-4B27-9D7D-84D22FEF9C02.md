# Interface Selection Rules

The following rules apply when assigning a pin to the RX\_DDRX\_B\_G\_A, RX\_DDRX\_B\_R\_A, and RX\_DDRX\_B\_G\_C interfaces:

-   Interface uses two ICB\_CLKDIVDELAY and three HS\_IO\_CLK.
-   RX\_CLK input must be placed in an I/O with the CLKIN\_z\_w function in the same bank as other I/Os.
-   RX and RX\_CLK I/Os must be placed in the same bank \(exception on device with bank7, I/Os can be either in both bank0 and bank7\).
-   One IOD per data I/Os.
-   One IOA per data and clock I/Os.
-   IOA from two different interfaces \(TX/RX/DDR/QDR/OCTAL/CDR\) cannot be placed in the same I/O lane.
