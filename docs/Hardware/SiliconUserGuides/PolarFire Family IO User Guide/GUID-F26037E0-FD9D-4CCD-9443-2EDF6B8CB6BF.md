# Point-to-Point Differential Signaling \(PPDS\)

PPDS is the next generation of the RSDS standards introduced by National Semiconductor Corporation, and is used to interface to next-generation LCD row and column drivers. PPDS inputs require a parallel termination resistor.

GPIO supports PPDS in both receive and transmit modes. HSIO supports PPDS only in receive mode and requires an external resistor.
