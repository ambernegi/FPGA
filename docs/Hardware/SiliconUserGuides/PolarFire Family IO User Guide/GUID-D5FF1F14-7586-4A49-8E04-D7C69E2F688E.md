# Interface Ports

The following table lists the RX\_DDR\_B\_C and RX\_DDR\_B\_A interface mode ports.

|Port|I/O|Description|
|----|---|-----------|
|RX|Input|Input DDR data. Supports up to 128-bits for \_G interfaces and 11-bit for \_R interfaces.|
|RX\_CLK|Input|Input DDR clock.|
|ARST\_N|Input|Asynchronous reset to IOD and lane controller. ARST\_N inputs are independent asynchronous resets to both the Rx and Tx IOD blocks.|
|HS\_IO\_CLK\_PAUSE|Input|Toggling the HS\_IO\_PAUSE:– Resets the IOD<br /> RX state machines. This reset re-synchronizes pattern to HS\_IO\_CLK<br /> \(bank clock\) and RXCLK.– Resets any<br /> adjustment done through SLIP operation.–<br /> Resets the IOD TX state machines. This reset synchronizes HS\_IO\_CLK<br /> and TXCLK.– HS\_IO\_CLK\_PAUSE must be pulsed<br /> after PLL lock is asserted in fractional aligned mode allowing the<br /> I/O Gearing state machine to detect the phase difference between<br /> fabric clock and clock coming out of PLL.– HS\_IO\_PAUSE does<br /> not disrupt delay line value settings.|
|L\#\_RX\_DATA\[m:0\]|Output|DDR output to FPGA fabric. ‘m’ equals the output pins from the geared DDR component to the fabric where the even numbered pin is the rising edge data and the odd numbered pin is the falling edge data of the DDR signal. The number of fabric pins are based on the number of I/Os and the gearing ratio.L\# is associated with the \# of external input pins up to 128 maximum.|
|RX\_CLK\_R/ RX\_CLK\_G|Output|Receive clock to FPGA fabric using a global \(G\) or regional \(R\) clock. Global and regional can be used for aligned interfaces. Center-aligned interfaces can only use global clock.|
