# Interface Ports

The following table lists the TX\_DDR\_G\_A interface mode ports.

|Port|I/O|Description|
|----|---|-----------|
|TX\_DATA\[m:0\]|Input|DDR transmit data from fabric. ‘m’ equals the input pins to the DDR component from the fabric where the even numbered pin is the data transmitted on the falling edge of TX\_CLK and the odd numbered pin is the data transmitted on the rising of TX\_CLK of the DDR signal. The number of fabric pins are based on the number of I/Os and the gearing ratio.|
|TX\_CLK\_G|Input|DDR transmit clock from fabric, and routed through global clock network.|
|TXD/TXD\_N\(m\)|Output|DDR output to IOAs|
|TX\_CLK|Input|DDR clock to IOAs|
|HS\_IO\_CLK\_PAUSE|Input|Toggles the HS\_IO\_CLK\_PAUSE Resets the IOD TX state<br /> machines This reset synchronizes HS\_IO\_CLK and TXCLK. It<br /> takes 5 to 10 clock cycles after deassertion of HS\_IO\_CLK\_PAUSE<br /> until valid TX\_DATA is accepted by the IOD. HS\_IO\_PAUSE does not<br /> disrupt delay line value settings.|
|ARST\_N|Input|Asynchronous reset to IOD and lane controller Asserting ARST\_N to the TX IODs<br /> resets the IOD TX gearbox stopping the TXD and TX\_CLK signals.<br /> During reset, the programmable output delay are set to 0. After the<br /> reset is released, the programmable output delay are reloaded to the<br /> programmed values.|

**Note:** Other pins are visible when advanced options are used. See [Generic IOD Interface Implementation](GUID-8222AB9C-2F29-47B9-8E42-AF75F97A64B1.md).
