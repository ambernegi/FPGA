# RX\_DDR Fractional Aligned/Fractional Dynamic Interfaces

The DDR fractional aligned IOD mode is used when the receive clock is a fraction of the data rate. A CCC PLL is inserted by Libero SoC into the clock path with a multiplier of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 10 to match data bit rate. For example, source synchronous clock input RX\_CLK \(which is data-rate / 4\) is provided as a reference clock to a fabric PLL, and generates the HS\_IO\_CLK which is 2X the RX\_CLK. With statically trained interface, the static delays to ensure the HS\_IO\_CLK clock edge alignment within the RXD data bit window. This pre-instantiated PLL also generates the fabric clock \(equal to the RX\_CLK or data-rate / 4\), which is used by the user logic in the fabric to clock the RX\_DATA bits coming out of the IOD macro into the fabric.

Both RX\_DDRX\_FA and RX\_DDRX\_FDYN include PLLs as required to receive a clock that is<br /> slower than the data rate. RX\_DDRX\_FA IOD macro use Libero predefined static settings to<br /> adjust the clock and data alignment. RX\_DDRX\_FDYN IOD macro is similar but it also<br /> includes the control and status ports required for the alignment which is controlled by<br /> the training IP. Both operate similarly except for the training aspect of the<br /> RX\_DDRX\_FDYN. The following figure shows functional waveforms for RX\_DDRX\_FA and<br /> RX\_DDRX\_FDYN.

The following figures shows the waveform diagram of fractional aligned data and clock.
