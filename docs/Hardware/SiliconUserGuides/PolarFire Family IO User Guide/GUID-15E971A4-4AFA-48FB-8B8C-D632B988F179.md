# LVDS

GPIO and HSIO banks can receive LVDS input signals. For GPIO, these inputs have<br /> an internal 100Ω differential termination resistor that can be enabled by the Libero SoC<br /> software. HSIO does not have this internal resistor capability. HSIO requires a 100Ω resistor<br /> across the P and N pair of the LVDS inputs. This requires careful PCB layout to provide this<br /> termination close to the device pins. The LVDS25 IOSTD is supported only for input and output<br /> I/Os \(TRIBUF and INOUT is not supported\).

HSIO banks only support LVDS18 inputs. LVDS18 outputs are not available. Only<br /> emulated LVDS-like outputs with lower performance are available in HSIO banks. True LVDS<br /> outputs are natively available in GPIO banks. Use either VDDI = 2.5V or 3.3V \(LVDS25 or<br /> LVDS33\) or LVDS18G with VDDI = 1.8V and VDDAUX = 2.5V. See [LVDS in GPIO Banks with VDDI = 1.8V](GUID-C7322514-FDC5-46D7-A56F-359F6CC1C55A.md#GUID-DE30132D-1456-47DA-BDC5-091A436CEFA6) for more information about<br /> GPIO LVDS18G inputs and outputs.

LVDS outputs are not<br /> available in HSIO banks.
