# Scalable Low-Voltage Signaling \(SLVS\)

SLVS is a chip-to-chip signaling standard designed for maximum performance with minimum power consumption, inheriting low noise susceptibility from LVDS. The standard features a scaled-down â€¨400 mV signal swing, versus the 700 mV swing of LVDS, and includes a ground reference. GPIO and HSIO banks support the SLVS I/O standards, but an external resistor is required for transmitter mode.
