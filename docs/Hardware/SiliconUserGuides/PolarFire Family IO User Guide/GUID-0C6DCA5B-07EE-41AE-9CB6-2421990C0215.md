# Bus-LVDS Emulated \(BLVDSE25\) Output Mode

BLVDS is used in multipoint, bidirectional, and heavily-loaded backplane<br /> applications. The effective impedance of these systems is lower<br /> than a typical pair of PCB traces due to the backplane<br /> capacitance, the connectors on the backplane, and the line<br /> stubs. The following illustration shows an example of BLVDS<br /> implementation using 90Ω stub resistors at every drop and 55Ω<br /> stub resistors on either side of the bus. The termination values<br /> at the end of the bus, which can range anywhere between 45Ω and<br /> 90Ω, must be optimized through PCB design simulations to match<br /> the effective differential impedance of the bus. In this<br /> example, the two parallel 55Ω stub discrete termination<br /> resistors yield an effective 27Ω differential termination.
