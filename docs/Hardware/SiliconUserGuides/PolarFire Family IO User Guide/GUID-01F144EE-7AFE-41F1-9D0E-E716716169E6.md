# Mixed I/O in VDDI Banks

Each bank has a VDDI supply that powers the single-ended output drivers and the ratio input buffers such as LVTTL and LVCMOS. In addition to the bank VDDI supply, the GPIO banks include an auxiliary supply \(VDDAUX\) that powers the differential and referenced input buffers. Similarly, in HSIO banks, there are VDDI power pins, however, there are no dedicated VDDAUX pins as the VDD18 supply is used to power the differential and referenced input buffers. This flexibility of power supplies to the I/O provides independence for mixing I/O standards in the same bank.

PolarFire Family FPGA inputs are designed to support mixing assignment for<br /> certain I/O standards, allowing I/O using compatible standards to be placed in the same I/O<br /> bank. The GPIO are self-protecting, which supports mixed input voltage combinations. It also<br /> supports over-voltage conditions because of its hot-swap design. For example, when VDDI is set<br /> to 3.3V, a input receiver of 3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V, and 1.2V. LVCMOS can be placed in the same I/O<br /> bank.

The mixing of different I/O within a bank is supported by the Libero SoC software. Before placing any mixed I/O voltage, you must first set the bank to the desired VDDI voltage followed by setting the attributes of the I/O that allows for mixed mode. Placing the I/O must be the last step. When implementing mixed I/O mode restrictions on ODT, CLAMP and RES\_PULL must be followed. The HSIO receivers have a reduced set of compatible I/O standards because the I/O clamp-diode is set to ON. For GPIO, if the signaling levels of the receiver are greater than the VDDI of the bank, the clamp must be set to OFF. See the following tables for details on valid attributes.

**Important:** When using mixed-mode receivers, the DC Input Levels \(VIH and VIL\) meet the desired I/O Standard level as referenced in [PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-DS00003831.pdf), [PolarFire SoC FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf), [RT PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/RT-PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-00004122A.pdf), or [RT PolarFire SoC Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf). In this case, VIH and VIL are not derived from the actual VDDI supplied to the targeted mixed-mode I/O bank. For example, if 3.3V is connected to the VDDI bank supply, and a mixed I/O Standard is configured to LVCMOS18, the VIL and VIH relates to the LVCMOS18 I/O standard referenced to VDDI = 1.8V in the DC Input Levels specifications. The VIL and VIH do not relate to the actual 3.3V VDDI.

The following tables list VDDI and mixed receiver compatibility for GPIO, HSIO for single-ended, reference and differential inputs. The tables list that inputs can be mixed within specific banks and still meet the I/O standards VIH/VIL requirements independent of the VDDI applied to the banks.

[Table   1](#ID-000025F0) lists the compatible<br /> I/O types when mixing within the VDDI banks. Using the table for example, a VDDI low<br /> voltage of 1.2V in GPIO can include LVCMOS33 inputs. Similarly, a VDDI low voltage of<br /> 1.2V cannot include LVCMOS18 inputs.

1.  ODT must be OFF for all cases.
2.  Single-ended I/O with Vref cannot be used in mixed voltage. Single-ended I/O with Vref can only be supported when I/O standard is set to correct VDDI.
