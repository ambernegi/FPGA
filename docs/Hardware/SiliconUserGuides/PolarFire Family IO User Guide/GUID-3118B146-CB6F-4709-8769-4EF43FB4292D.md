# Sub-LVDS

Sub-LVDS is a differential low-voltage standard that is a subset of LVDS, and uses a<br /> reduced-voltage swing and lower common-mode voltage compared to LVDS. For sub-LVDS, the<br /> maximum differential swing is less than 350 mV, as in LVDS. For more information on the<br /> maximum differential swing values, see the respective device datasheet. The nominal<br /> common-mode voltage for sub-LVDS is 0.9V, while it is 1.25V for LVDS. GPIO supports<br /> sub-LVDS in both receive and transmit modes. HSIO supports sub-LVDS only in the receive<br /> mode and requires an external resistor. The common mode voltage and differential voltage<br /> swing are key differences between Sub-LVDS and LVDS. PolarFire/PolarFire SoC to<br /> PolarFire/PolarFire SoC, RT PolarFire to RT PolarFire, and RT PolarFire SoC to RT PolarFire<br /> SoC interfaces allow LVDS to sub-LVDS and sub-LVDS to LVDS as the data sheet specifications<br /> permit these levels to operate within their specified ranges.
