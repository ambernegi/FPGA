# I/O Initialization

High-speed I/O have many stages of initialization that are involved in optimizing I/O performance. These stages include the following:

-   I/O calibration
-   I/O training
-   Memory controller calibration or training

These phases of I/O initialization and the underlying timing paths are very critical in guaranteeing optimized performance of the high-speed I/O interfaces. A general understanding is required regarding the methodologies used for analyzing system timing.
