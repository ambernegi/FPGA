# I/O Primitive

The macro library includes a list of I/O primitives to support various I/O standards. Following are the generic I/O primitives, representing most of the available I/O standards.

-   INBUF—represents input buffer
-   INBUF\_DIFF—represents differential input buffer
-   OUTBUF—represents output buffer
-   OUTBUF\_DIFF—represents differential output buffer
-   TRIBUFF—represents tristate buffer
-   TRIBUFF\_DIFF—represents differential tristate buffer
