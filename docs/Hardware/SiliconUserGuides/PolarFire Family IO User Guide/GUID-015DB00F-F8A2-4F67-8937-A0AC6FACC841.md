# PolarFire Family I/O Banks

PolarFire SoC and RT PolarFire SoC FPGA devices have eight user I/O banks,<br /> whereas PolarFire and RT PolarFire FPGA devices have five, six, or eight user I/O banks<br /> depending upon the device size. In PolarFire SoC and RT PolarFire SoC FPGA devices, the<br /> banks assigned to the MSS are only for dedicated use with the MSS block and are not<br /> accessible to the FPGA fabric. MSS\_DDR, MSS\_IO, MSS\_SGMII, and MSS\_REFCLK are only used<br /> with MSS block. For information about MSS bank, see [PolarFire SoC FPGA Packaging and Pin Descriptions User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/microchip_polarfire_soc_fpga_packaging_and_pin_descriptions_user_guide_vb.pdf).

The I/O banks on the north side of the device support only HSIO. Each I/O bank has dedicated I/O supplies and grounds. Each I/O within a given bank shares the same VDDI power supply and VREF reference voltage. Only compatible I/O standards can be assigned to a given I/O bank.

Each bank contains a bank power detector and a bank receiver reference voltage generator to create an internally generated reference voltage, VREF. Each bank also interfaces with a PVT controller to calibrate the I/O buffer output driver strengths and termination values \(needed only for certain I/O standards\). The PVT controller generates a set of codes to control the source driver and the sink driver, and also calibrates the HSIO output slew. Each I/O buffer has individual drive-strength programmability to multiply the PVT digital code value by a drive setting to create the desired drive, impedance, or termination settings. For more information, see [I/O Analog \(IOA\) Buffer Programmable Features](GUID-CC29CF66-77AD-471C-8A06-94A7337826B5.md).

[Figure   1](#GUID-D9C2332F-D163-483D-BAA1-2EAFEB1F7340) through [Figure   5](#GUID-69808E93-3F8B-4BCB-A352-488733EEF9E7) show simplified<br /> floor plans for each device, including the bank locations. These figures also show the<br /> corner block and transceiver block. The corner block includes CCCs, two PLLs, and two<br /> DLLs each, providing flexible clock management and synthesis for the FPGA fabric,<br /> external system, and I/Os. All banks are not available in all devices, see [I/O Lanes in Each Bank](GUID-2227C38D-7FCE-4A20-9B53-28D953767052.md) for more<br /> information.
