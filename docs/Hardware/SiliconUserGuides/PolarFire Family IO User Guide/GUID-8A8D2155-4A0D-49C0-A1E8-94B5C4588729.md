# Compensated Drive Impedance and Terminations

Resistors are used to match the impedance of the trace. However, adding<br /> resistors close to device pins increases the size of the board<br /> area and component count, and can in some cases be physically<br /> impossible. To address these issues, a reference controller<br /> between the VDDI power supply, and pad signal is used to control<br /> the source and sink drivers between the pad and the ground. This<br /> compensation happens at power up, and on-demand by the user<br /> logic. The I/O compensation adjusts the impedances inside the<br /> GPIO or HSIO bank by comparing to the internal reference. The<br /> impedance change in I/O compensation is due to process<br /> variation. The compensation logic adjusts the impedance of the<br /> GPIO or HSIO by selectively turning the transistors ON or OFF in<br /> the I/Os. The impedance is adjusted to match the internal<br /> reference by doing an initial adjustment when the power-on<br /> detector for VDDI and VDDAUX gets to a minimal value. The change<br /> in impedance also compensates for Temperature variation and<br /> Supply Voltage fluctuations. Both input and output compensation<br /> are a function performed as part of I/O calibration.
