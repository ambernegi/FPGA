**Note:** For RT PolarFire FPGA, you must familiarize yourself with single event latch-up risks in GPIO banks before selecting 2.5V or 3.3V I/Os. See [RT PolarFire Heavy Ion Radiation Single Event Latch-Up Test Report](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/RT+PolarFire+Heavy+Ion+SEL+Test+Report+Final+Rev+1+2021-12-10.pdf).
