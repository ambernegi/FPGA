# Reduced-Swing Differential Signal \(RSDS\)

RSDS is similar to an LVDS high-speed interface using differential signaling,<br /> but with a smaller voltage swing and requiring a parallel termination resistor. RSDS is only<br /> intended for point-to-point applications. For more information about RSDS Voltage Swing, see<br /> the respective [PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-DS00003831.pdf), [PolarFire SoC FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf), [RT PolarFire FPGA Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/RT-PolarFire-FPGA-Datasheet-00004122A.pdf), or [RT PolarFire SoC Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PolarFire-SoC-Datasheet-DS00004248.pdf).

While GPIO supports RSDS receive and trasmit modes, HSIO supports RS,DS receive<br /> mode with an external 100Î© on-board termination.
