# Example Training Algorithm

To train the algorithm, perform the following steps:

1.  A spare IOD is used for this clock-to-clock training using the spare IOG data-eye feature. In this example, the SCLK is the data, and the BCLK90 is the clock. The PLL reference clock is using 100 MHz and the PLL generates the clocks for MAX data rate of 1600 Mbps.

    |PLL Clock Output|Clock Description|Clock Frequency|
    |----------------|-----------------|---------------|
    |PLL\_OUT\[0\]|MEMCLK|800 MHz|
    |PLL\_OUT\[1\]|SCLK|200 MHz|
    |PLL\_OUT\[2\]|BCLK|800 MHz|
    |PLL\_OUT\[3\]|BCLK90|800 MHz[1](#GUID-46B849E6-0B23-4A37-ACE0-8FA7CB097D5B)|

    **Note:**

    1.  BCLK90 is always set at the start after the PLL Lock by moving the PLL VCOPHSEL in 45° through PLL ROTATE increment by 2, so as to follow BCLK by 90° shift.
2.  Align BCLK90 to SCLK. The control mechanism is by moving the PLL VCOPHSEL in 45° increments<br /> \(smallest available\) to phase shift BCLK/BCLK90 relative to the SCLK.

    Transition detection mechanism is used to find positive edge to positive edge crossing between<br /> BCLK . DDRx2 mode requires 2 bits for the transition detection. The<br /> BCLK\_IGEAR\_RX\[1\] transition from 1 to 0 and BCLK\_IGEAR\_RX\[0\] transition from 0<br /> to 1 or vice-versa is used for the transition detection.

    The following figure shows an example waveform which describes the transition detection and the relationship achieved through PLL\_BCLKPHS\_OFFSET\[2:0\]

3.  Offset BCLK90 relative to SCLK is achieved by<br /> changing the PLL VCOPHSEL controls, appropriately. The BCLK to BCLK90<br /> relationship is previously locked as defined in the preceding step and in the<br /> preceding figure.

    The IOD BCLK input pin always uses the BCLK90. The SCLK<br /> is sourced from the PLL and BCLKs are sourced from the PLL. Although, the SCLK<br /> phase is locked by the PLL and never is shifted, there may be significant PVT<br /> variations producing a need for re-training. Maximizing BCLK90 versus SCLK<br /> timing margin reduces the need for re-training.

    This training procedure defines the BCLK90 to SCLK phase relationship by moving BCLK90. When the BCLK90s phase is adjusted, BCLK90 can never be changed by any subsequent training. BCLK becomes fixed after this point.
