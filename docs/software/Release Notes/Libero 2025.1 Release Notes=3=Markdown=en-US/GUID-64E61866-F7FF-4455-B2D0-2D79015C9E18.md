# Introduction

The Libero® SoC Design Suite offers high<br /> productivity with its comprehensive, easy-to-learn, easy-to-adopt development tools for<br /> designing with Microchip FPGA and SoC device families. It provides you with an integrated<br /> hardware tool suite incorporating RTL entry through bitstream programming, a rich IP library,<br /> and complete reference designs and development kits. Libero SoC Design Suite includes SmartHLS™ compiler software for abstracted high-level synthesis development<br /> flow, which shortens design time, simplifies verification, and accelerates time to market for<br /> designs using our FPGAs.

Use Libero SoC v2025.1 for designing with the following Microchip devices:

-   [RT PolarFire](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/radiation-tolerant-fpgas/rt-polarfire-fpgas), [RT PolarFire SoC](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/radiation-tolerant-fpgas/rt-polarfire-soc) and [RTG4™](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/radiation-tolerant-fpgas/rtg4-radiation-tolerant-fpgas) Rad-Tolerant FPGAs
-   [PolarFire® SoC](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/system-on-chip-fpgas/polarfire-soc-fpgas) and [SmartFusion® 2](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/system-on-chip-fpgas/smartfusion-2-fpgas) SoC FPGAs
-   [PolarFire](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas/polarfire-fpgas) and [IGLOO® 2](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas/igloo-2-fpgas) FPGAs

To design with older Microchip FPGA family devices, use [Libero SoC v11.9](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-early-versions) or [Libero IDE v9.2](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-ide) and its subsequent service packs.

To access datasheets, silicon user guides, tutorials, and application notes, visit the [Microchip website](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds), navigate to the relevant product family page, and<br /> then click the **Documentation** tab. Development kits and boards are<br /> listed in the **Kits and Hardware** tab.

**Important:** Libero SoC v2025.1 does not support Classic Constraint flow. IGLOO2, SmartFusion2, and RTG4 projects using the “Classic” flow cannot be opened in this release. A migration path is available for transitioning from the Classic Constraint Flow to the Enhanced Constraint Flow. For more information, see [Migrating an Existing Project Created with Classic Constraint Flow to Enhanced Constraint Flow](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/12_0_0/Tool/libero_soc_ccf_ecf_migration.pdf).
