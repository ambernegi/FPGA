# FDDR 16-bit and 8-bit Width Modes with ECC Enabled

-   Updated IP core top-level DQ\_ECC port bit mapping to device package pin FDDR\_DQ\_ECC\[\#\] for proper ECC functionality.
-   RTG4 DDR DQ works as expected when SECDED is enabled.
-   When opening a pre-2025.1 RTG4 design that uses the RTG4 FDDR in x16 or x8 modes, the design is invalidated to a pre-synthesis state.
-   Applicable for designs that contain instances of the RTG4FDDRC or RT4FDDRC\_INIT core configured for 16-bit or 8-bit DQ width with ECC enabled.
-   The core component must be updated to an RTG4 version 2.0.200 or later and regenerated to continue with the design flow.
-   Review the latest RTG4 Package Pin Assignment Table \(PPAT\) available on the Microchip website to ensure the board layout has connected the correct FDDR\_&lt;E\|W&gt;\_DQ\_ECC&lt;\#&gt; package pin to the DDR memory device holding ECC data, depending on the DQ bit-width in use.
