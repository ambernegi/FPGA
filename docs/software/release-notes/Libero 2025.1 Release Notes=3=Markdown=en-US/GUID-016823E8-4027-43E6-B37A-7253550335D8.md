# **Enhanced copy and paste functionality for SmartDesign HDL+ cores**

Starting with the Libero SoC v2025.1 release, HDL+ core instances can be selected and<br /> copied from a SmartDesign and pasted into a new SmartDesign in any order, regardless of<br /> their original creation and instantiation sequence, without corrupting the SmartDesign<br /> canvas component and resulting in crashes.

Additionally, crashes related to hierarchical SmartDesign creation with HDL+ core<br /> instances being selected have also been resolved.
