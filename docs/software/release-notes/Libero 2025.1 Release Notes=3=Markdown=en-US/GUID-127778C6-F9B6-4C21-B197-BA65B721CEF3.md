# ModelSim ME Pro and QuestaSim Pro ME Simulator Tools Upgrade

The Libero SoC v2025.1 release supports the upgraded v2024.3 versions of ModelSim ME Pro and<br /> QuestaSim ME simulation tools.

To enable better simulation runtime, QuestaSim ME optimizes designs during<br /> compilation by default. This optimization can sometimes result in the removal of<br /> signals or objects that the user might want to observe during simulation. The<br /> historical vsim argument called `-novopt` is now deprecated;<br /> instead, the simulator supports the `-voptargs` parameter, which<br /> allows users to add arguments that specify the level of optimization applied and<br /> the level of design object visibility during simulation. For example, the vsim<br /> argument `-voptargs=+acc` can be used to enable access to design<br /> objects that might otherwise be optimized away. For additional information, refer<br /> to the appropriate user guide from Siemens EDA \(formerly Mentor Graphics\).

<br />

**Note:** Libero SoC v2025.1 is the final release to use ModelSim ME Pro as the default simulator.
