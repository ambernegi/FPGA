# sd\_copy\_paste

## Description

This Tcl command used to copies and pastes ports, nets and instances within or cross SmartDesign.

**Note:** The "net" can be copied and pasted if at least two connections are specified. This command is not required to build a SmartDesign component. It maps to an interactive user action in the SmartDesign Canvas and will not be present in the 'Export Component Description\(Tcl\)' but will present in Libero Project 'Export Script File'. You must specify at least one valid instance or port.

```
sd_copy_paste -sd_name {SmartDesign component name} \
              -source_sd_name {source SmartDesign name} \
              [-instance_names {instance names}] \
              [-port_names {port names}] \
              [-net_names {net names}]
```

|None|Parameter 'sd\_name' has illegal value.|
|None|Required parameter 'source\_sd\_name' is missing.|
|None|The paste command failed for net 'net\_name' in SmartDesign 'sd'. The net could not be found in the source SmartDesign.|
|None|Parameter 'net\_names' has illegal value.|
|None|The paste command failed for port 'port\_name' in SmartDesign 'sd'. The port could not be found in the source SmartDesign.|

## Example

The following example copies "AND2\_0" instance, "A", "B", "Y" ports with their appropriate nets from "sd1" and pastes into "sd2":

```
sd_copy_paste -sd_name {sd2} -source_sd_name {sd1} -instance_names {"AND2_0"} \
	      -port_names {"A" "B" "Y"} -net_names {"A" "B" "Y"}
```

The following example copies only "NAND2\_0" instance from "sd1" and pastes in "sd2":

```
sd_copy_paste -sd_name {sd2} -source_sd_name {sd1} -instance_names {"NAND2_0"}
```

The following example copies only "A", "B", "Y" ports from "sd1" and pastes in "sd2":

```
sd_copy_paste -sd_name {sd2} -source_sd_name {sd1} -port_names {"A" "B" "Y"}
```
