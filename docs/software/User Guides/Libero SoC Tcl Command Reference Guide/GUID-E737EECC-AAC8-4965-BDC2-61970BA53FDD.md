# complete\_debug\_job

## Description

Completes the current open job and generates a job status container including cryptographically<br /> signed Job Ticket end certifiers and Certificates of Conformance \(if enabled\) of the<br /> programmed devices. It archives ticket data from the HSM database. The resultant Job<br /> Status container can be imported into Job Manager and validated using U-HSM. If the<br /> job status file is not specified, the information is printed in the log window and<br /> no Job Status container is created for subsequent verification.

The HSM Job can be completed only if the number of devices in each HSM ticket has been exhausted.<br /> If devices remain, the job can only be terminated by using the<br /> `-terminate` option.

**Note:** This command fails if there are devices left in any HSM ticket and the terminate option is not used.

``` {#CODEBLOCK_Z4R_PX1_K5B}
