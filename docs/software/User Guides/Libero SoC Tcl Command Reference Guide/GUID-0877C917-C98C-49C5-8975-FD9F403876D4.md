# check\_pdc\_constraints

## Description

This Tcl command checks Physical Design Constraints \(PDC\) constraint files associated with the Libero Place and Route tool. PDC Tcl is divided between I/O attribute and pin information from all floorplanning and timing constraints.

-   The I/O Attributes tab allows you to manage I/O attributes/constraints for your design’s Inputs, Outputs and Inouts. All I/O constraint files \(PDC\) have the \*.pdc file extension and are placed in the `<project_location>/constraint/io` folder.
-   The Floor Planner tab allows you to manage floorplanning constraints. Floorplanning constraints files have the \*.pdc file extension and are placed in the `<project_location>\constraint\fp` folder.
