# Command Substitution

By using square brackets \(\[\]\), you can substitute the result of one command as an<br /> argument to a subsequent command, as shown in the following example:

```
set a 12
set b [expr $a*4]
```

Tcl handles everything between square brackets as a nested Tcl command. Tcl evaluates<br /> the nested command and substitutes its result in place of the bracketed text. In the<br /> example above, the argument that appears in square brackets in the second set<br /> command is equal to 48 \(that is, 12\* 4 = 48\).

Conceptually,

```
set b [expr $a * 4]
```

expands to

```
set b [expr 12 * 4 ]
```

and then to

```
set b 48
```
