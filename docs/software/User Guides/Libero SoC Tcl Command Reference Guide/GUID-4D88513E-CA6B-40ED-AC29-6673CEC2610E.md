# sb\_move\_core

## Description

This Tcl command is used to move cores from one Subsystem to another in the<br /> **Peripherals** page of System Builder. In the exported Tcl<br /> description file of a System Builder component, the only scenario where this command<br /> will be seen is when the Fabric DDR is used and is moved from its default 'Fabric<br /> DDR Subsystem' to a different Subsystem in the **Peripherals**<br /> page.

**Note:** In a System Builder design, if the Fabric External DDR Memory \(FDDR\) is enabled on the **Device Features** page, then the Fabric DDR Subsystem is automatically enabled with the core Fabric\_DDR\_RAM added to it in the **Peripherals** page.

A Fabric AMBA Master configured<br /> as AXI or AHBLite can be added to the Fabric DDR Subsystem to enable a<br /> fabric master to access external DDR memory using FDDR. Alternatively, the<br /> Fabric DDR RAM can also be moved \(drag and drop\) to other Subsystems in the<br /> Peripherals page so that the master\(s\) in that Subsystem will also be able<br /> to access external DDR memory using FDDR.

For example, the<br /> Fabric\_DDR\_RAM can be moved from its default 'Fabric DDR Subsystem' to 'MSS<br /> FIC\_0 - MSS Master Subsystem' \(FIC0\_Master\_Subsystem\) which will enable<br /> Cortex-M3 in the MSS to access external DDR memory using FDDR via FIC\_0<br /> Master address space. The Tcl command `sb_move_core` will be<br /> used to capture the action of moving the Fabric\_DDR\_RAM to a different<br /> Subsystem in the exported Tcl description for a System Builder<br /> component.

```
sb_move_core \
-component_name {component_name} \
[-core_name {core_name}] \
-subsystem_name {subsystem_name}

```

## Arguments

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|

|-core\_name \{core\_name\}|string|Optional. Name of the instance of the core in the System Builder<br /> component.|
|-subsystem\_name \{subsystem\_name\}|string|Mandatory. Name of the subsystem the core is being added<br /> to.|

## Example

```
sb_move_core -component_name {sb} -core_name {Fabric_DDR_RAM} -subsystem_name {FIC0_Master_Subsystem}
```
