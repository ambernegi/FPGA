# VERIFYTIMING

## Description

"VERIFYTIMING" is a command tool used in configure\_tool and run\_tool. Use "configure\_tool -name \{VERIFYTIMING\}" to configure "VERIFYTIMING" tool, run\_tool passes a script file that contains timing specific Tcl commands to the VERIFYTIMING command and executes it.

**Note:** At least one "parameter:value" must be specified. You can repeat `-params` argument for multiple parameters.

```
configure_tool -name {VERIFYTIMING} -params {parameter:value}
run_tool -name {VERIFYTIMING} -script {timing.tcl}
```

Where, `timing.tcl` is a script that contains the SmartTime-specific Tcl<br /> commands. You can include SmartTime-specific Tcl commands to create user path, to<br /> set and generate timing reports.

## Example

The following example specifies text as the Report format and turns on report generation for Constraint\_coverage report, the Max\_Delay\_Analysis Timing Report based on Slow process, Low Voltage, and High Temperature and the Max\_Delay\_Analysis Timing Violation Report based on Slow Process, Low Voltage, and High Temperature operating conditions. The script turns off Min\_Delay\_Analysis Timing Violation Report generation based on Slow process, Low Voltage, and High Temperature operating conditions. It also sets the maximum number of timing paths to 25 and maximum slack threshold of 0.04:

```

configure_tool -name {VERIFYTIMING} \
               -params {FORMAT:txt} \
               -params {CONSTRAINT_COVERAGE:1} \
               -params {MAX_TIMING_SLOW_LV_HT:1} \
               -params {MAX_TIMING_VIOLATIONS_SLOW_LV_HT:1} \
               -params {MIN_TIMING_VIOLATIONS_SLOW_LV_HT:0}
               -params {MAX_PATHS_TIMING:25} \
               -params {SLACK_THRESHOLD_VIOLATION:0.04}
		    
run_tool -name {VERIFYTIMING} -script {timing.tcl}
```
