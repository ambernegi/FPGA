# Print Statement and Return Values

**Parent topic:**[Tcl Scripting Overview](GUID-57D1B766-9771-410F-B0F1-9199613DB164.md)

## Print Statement

Use the puts command to write a string to an output channel. Predefined output<br /> channels are “stdout” and “stderr.” If you do not specify a channel, then puts<br /> display text to the stdout channel.

**Note:** The STDIN Tcl command is not supported by Microchip SoC tools.

For example:

```
set a [ myprog arg1 arg2 ]
puts "the answer from myprog was $a (this text is on stdout)" 
puts stdout “this text also is on stdout”
```

## Return Values

The return code of a Tcl command is a string. You can use a return value as an<br /> argument to another function by enclosing the command with square brackets \[ \]. For<br /> example:

```
set a [ prog arg1 arg2 ] exec $a
```

The Tcl command “exec” will run an external program. The return value of “exec” is<br /> the output \(on stdout\) from the program. For example:

```
set tmp [ exec myprog ] puts stdout $tmp
```
