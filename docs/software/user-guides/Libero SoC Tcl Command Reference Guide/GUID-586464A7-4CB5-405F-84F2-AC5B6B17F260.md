# Control Structures

Tcl control structures are commands that change the flow of execution through a<br /> script. These control structures include commands for conditional execution<br /> \(if-then-elseif-else\) and looping \(while, for, catch\).

An "if" statement only executes the body of the statement \(enclosed between curly<br /> braces\) if the Boolean condition is found to be true.

## if/else Statements

```
if { “$name” == “paul” } then {
…
# body if name is paul
} elseif { $code == 0 } then {
…
# body if name is not paul and if value of variable code is zero
} else {
…
# body if above conditions is not true
}
```

## for Loop Statement

A "for" statement will repeatedly execute the body of the code as long as the index<br /> is within a specified limit.

```
for { set i 0 } { $i < 5 } { incr i } {
…
# body here
}
```

## while Loop Statement

A "while" statement will repeatedly execute the body of the code \(enclosed between<br /> the curly braces\) as long as the Boolean condition is found to be true.

```
while { $p > 0 } {
…
}
```

## catch Statement

A "catch" statement suspends normal error handling on the enclosed Tcl command. If a<br /> variable name is also used, then the return value of the enclosed Tcl command is<br /> stored in the variable.

```
catch { open “$inputFile” r } myresult
```
