# Programming the Application Bitstream

To program the application bit stream:

<br />

1.  Use Libero SoC or FlashProExpress to program the FPGA fabric array, sNVM, eNVM and any security settings.
2.  Use Libero SoC to program any eNVM client.

<br />

**Note:** SoftConsole must be used to program the Boot mode.

<br />

Alternatively, you can also perform the following steps:

1.  Use SoftConsole to program the eNVM with the First Stage Boot image.
    1.  Select the project you want programmed to eNVM in SoftConsoleâ€™s **Project Explorer** pane.
    2.  Click the **PolarFire SoC Boot Mode 1** external tool.

Programming progress messages appear in the Console.
