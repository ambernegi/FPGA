# read\_uprom\_memory

## Description

This Tcl command reads a uPROM memory block from the device.

**Note:**

If you have more than one clients configured in Libero and If you use client name with inappropriate -startaddress and -words then the command will fail.

```
read_uprom_memory [-deviceName "device name"] \
                  [-client "client name"] \
                  -startaddress "start address" \
                  -words "integer value" \
                  [-fileName "Data file name"]
```

## Arguments

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|deviceName|string​|Optional user-defined device name. The device name is not required if there is only one device in the current configuration, or a device has already been selected using the set\_debug\_device command.|
|client|string​|Specifie the name of client for memory read.Clients are configured in Libero tool under "device and memory initialisation". Those are a bunch of pages which can be used by the design to load data. Each client can have a different purpose.|
|startaddress|hexadecimal|Specifies the start address of the uPROM memory block.|
|words|integer|Specifies the number of 9-bit words.|
|fileName|string|Name of output file for memory read.|

|Return Type|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|String|Displays page status and data of uPROM memory with plain text format..|

## Error Codes

|Error Code|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|None|Parameter 'deviceName' has illegal value.|
|None​|Parameter 'client' has illegal value.|
|None​|Parameter 'startaddress' has illegal value.|
|None​|Required parameter 'startaddress' is missing.|
|None​|Parameter 'words' has illegal value.|
|None​|Required parameter 'words' is missing.|
|None​|Parameter 'fileName' has illegal value.|
|None​|Invalid argument value: ' -word \{1.0\} ' \(expecting integer value\).|
|None​|Parameter 'param\_name' is not defined. Valid command formatting is 'read\_uprom\_memory \[-deviceName "device name"\] \[-client "client name"\] -startaddress "start address" -words "integer value" \[-fileName "Data file name"\]'.|
|None|The startaddress value is incorrect for the client entered.|

</table>## Example

1.  This example reads 10 9-bit words from uPROM memory '0xA' address :

    ```
    read_uprom_memory –startaddress {0xA} –words {10}
    ```

2.  This example ​reads 9-bit words from uPROM memory '0xA' address :

    ```
    read_uprom_memory -client {client1} \
                      -startaddress "2" \
                      -words "2" \
                      -fileName "./data.txt"
    ```
