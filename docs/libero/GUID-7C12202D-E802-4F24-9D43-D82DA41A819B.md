# XCVR View

The XCVR View allows the user to make assignments for Transceiver Lanes, Reference Clocks and Transmit PLLs. It presents the following views:

-   A schematic view of the Reference Clock \(REFCLK\), the TransmitPLL, and the Transceiver Lanes they drive. See [Figure   1](GUID-7C12202D-E802-4F24-9D43-D82DA41A819B.md#GUID-B8C2DA43-AA49-4DEB-976B-A000AD4F64BF).
-   A graphical placement view of the REFCLK, its connection from the PADS, to the TransmitPLL, to the Transceiver Lanes. See [Figure   2](GUID-7C12202D-E802-4F24-9D43-D82DA41A819B.md#GUID-2E4DD603-02E4-4DC5-99B2-088C63247641).
-   A Signal Integrity View for a Transceiver Lane, showing TX Emphasis Amplitude, TX Impedance, TX Transmit Common Mode Adjustment, RX and TX Polarity, RX Insertion Loss, RX CTLE, RX Termination, RX P/N Board Connection, and RX Loss of Signal Detector \(Low and High\). See [Figure   3](GUID-7C12202D-E802-4F24-9D43-D82DA41A819B.md#GUID-08639D67-B7DA-451A-BE57-D1C344AA9300).
