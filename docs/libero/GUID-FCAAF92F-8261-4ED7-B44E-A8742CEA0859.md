# Introduction

This macro library guide supports the PolarFire® FPGA family.<br /> See the Microchip website for macro guides for other families.

This guide follows a naming convention for sequential macros that is<br /> unambiguous and extensible, making it possible to understand the function of the macros<br /> by their name alone.

The first two mandatory characters of the macro name will indicate the<br /> basic macro function:

-   DF—D-type flip-flop
-   DL—D-type latch

The next mandatory character indicates the output polarity:

-   I—output inverted \(QN with bubble\)
-   N—output non-inverted \(Q without bubble\)

The next mandatory number indicates the polarity of the clock or<br /> gate:

-   1—rising edge-triggered flip-flop or transparent high latch \(non-bubbled\)
-   0—falling edge-triggered flip-flop or transparent low latch \(bubbled\)

The next two optional characters indicate the polarity of the Enable<br /> pin, if present:

-   E0—active-low enable \(bubbled\)
-   E1—active-high enable \(non-bubbled\)

The next two optional characters indicate the polarity of the<br /> asynchronous Preset pin, if present:

-   P0—active-low asynchronous preset \(bubbled\)
-   P1—active-high asynchronous preset \(non-bubbled\)

The next two optional characters indicate the polarity of the<br /> asynchronous Clear pin, if present:

-   C0—active-low asynchronous clear \(bubbled\)
-   C1—active-high asynchronous clear \(non-bubbled\)

All sequential and combinatorial macros \(except MX4 and XOR8\) use one<br /> logic element in the PolarFire FPGA family.

As an example, the macro DFN1E1C0 indicates a D-type flip-flop \(DF\) with<br /> a non-inverted \(N\) Q output, positive-edge-triggered \(1\), with Active-High Clock Enable<br /> \(E1\) and Active-Low Asychronous Clear \(C0\). See the following table.

The truth table states in this User Guide are defined as follows:

|State|Meaning|
|-----|-------|
|0|Logic “0”|
|1|Logic “1”|
|X|Do not Care \(for Inputs\), Unknown \(for<br /> Outputs\)|
|Z|High Impedance|

**WARNING\_MSGS\_ON**

This feature enables you to disable the warning messages display.<br /> Default is ON \('True' in VHDL and '1' in Verilog\).
