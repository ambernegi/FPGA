# I/O PDC Commands

I/O PDC commands are used to set and reset I/O standards, voltages values, and attributes.

## set\_iobank

This PDC command sets the input/output supply voltage \(vcci\) and the input reference<br /> voltage \(vref\) for the specified I/O bank. DDRIO banks have a dedicated vref pin and you<br /> do not need to set any pin on these banks. \(See the device datasheet to see which banks<br /> are of type DDRIO.\)

Diff I/Os do not need a vref pin.

``` {#UL_TXQ_TDK_TNB}
set_iobank bankname \
[-vcci vcci_voltage]\ [-vref vref_voltage]\ [-fixed value]\
[-vrefpins value]\
[-updateiostd value]\
```

### Arguments

The following sections describe the `set_iobank` arguments.

bankname
:   Specifies the name of the bank. I/O banks are numbered 0 through N \(bank0, bank1,...bankN\). See the datasheet for your device to determine the number of banks.

-vcci vcci\_voltage
:   Sets the input/output supply voltage. You can enter one of the following<br /> values:

    |Vcci Voltage|Compatible Standards|
    |------------|--------------------|
    |3.3V|LVTTL, LVCMOS 3.3, PCI 3.3, LVPECL|
    |2.5V|LVCMOS 2.5, SSTL2 \(Class I and II\), LVDS, BUSLVDS,<br /> MLVDS, MINILVDS, RSDS|
    |1.8V|LVCMOS 1.8, LPDDRI, LPDDRII, SSTL18I|
    |1.5V|LVCMOS 1.5, SSTL 1.5 \(Class I and II\), HSTL \(Class I<br /> and II\)|
    |1.2V|LVCMOS 1.2|

-vref vref\_voltage
:   Sets the input reference voltage. You can enter one of the following<br /> values:

    |Vref Voltage|Compatible Standards|
    |------------|--------------------|
    |1.25V|SSTL2 \(Class I and II\)|
    |1.0V|SSTL18 \(Class I and II\), LPDDR \(Class I and<br /> II\)|
    |0.75V|SSTL15 \(Class I and II\), HSTL \(Class I and Class<br /> II\)|

-fixed Value
:   Specifies if the I/O technologies \(vcci and vccr voltage\) assigned to the<br /> bank are locked. You can enter one of the following values:

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |yes|The technologies are locked.|
    |no|The technologies are not locked.|

-vrefpins value
:   Specifies, if the I/O technologies \(vcci and vccr voltage\) assigned to<br /> the bank are locked. You can enter one of the following values:

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |default|Because the VREF pins are not locked, the I/O Bank<br /> Assigner can assign a VREF pin.|
    |pinnum|The specified VREF pin\(s\) are locked if the -fixed<br /> option is yes. The I/O Bank Assigner cannot remove<br /> locked VREF pins.|

-updateiostd Value
:   Specifies, if the I/O technologies \(vcci and vccr voltage\) assigned to<br /> the bank are locked. You can enter one of the following values:

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |yes|If there are I/Os placed on the bank, we keep the<br /> placement and change the host to one which is compatible<br /> with this bank setting. Check the I/O Attributes to see<br /> the one used by the tool.|
    |no|If there are I/Os placed and locked on the bank, the<br /> command will fail. If they are placed I/Os they will be<br /> unplaced.|

### Exceptions

Any pins assigned to the specified I/O bank that are incompatible with the default<br /> technology are unassigned.

### Examples

The following example assigns 3.3V to the input/output supply voltage \(vcci\) and 1.5V<br /> to the input reference voltage \(vref\) for I/O bank 0.

```
set_iobank bank0 -vcci 3.3 -vref 1.5
```

The following example shows that even though you can import a<br /> `set_iobank` command with the `-vrefpins`argument<br /> set to “default”, the exported PDC file shows the specific default pins instead of<br /> "default".

Imported PDC file contains:

```
set_iobank bank3 -vcci 3.3 -vref 1.8 -fixed yes -vrefpins {default}
```

Exported PDC file contains:

```
set_iobank bank3 -vcci 3.3 -vref 1.8 -fixed yes -vrefpins {N3 P8 M8}
```

## set\_io \(SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2\)

This PDC command sets the attributes of an I/O.

You can use the `set_io` command to assign an I/O technology, the I/O<br /> attributes, place, or lock the I/O at a given pin location. There are three I/O bank<br /> types available in SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2; MSIOD, MSIO, and DDRIO.

<br />

**Important:** For the I/O Register combining option, use the `set_ioff` command. See the [set\_ioff](GUID-B0082A32-AB1D-4BCA-8B59-F959035E9DE5.md#) command for more information.

<br />

```
set_io portname\
[-iostd value]\
[-pre_emphasis value]\ 
[-lpe value]\
[-ff_io_state value]\
[-out_drive value]\
[-slew value]\
[-res_pull value]\
[-schmitt_trigger value]\
[-in_delay value]\
[-odt_static value]\
[-odt_imp value]\
[-ff_io_avail value]\
[-pinname package_pin] \ 
[-fixed value] \
[-out_load value]
```

### Arguments

The following section describes `set_io` \(SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2\)<br /> arguments. The attributes below are case sensitive.

portname
:   Specify the portname of the I/O macro.

-iostd Value
:   Sets the I/O standard for this macro. Choosing a standard allows the<br /> software to set other attributes, such as the slew rate and output<br /> loading. If the voltage standard used with the I/O is not compatible<br /> with other I/Os in the I/O bank, then assigning an I/O standard to a<br /> port will invalidate its location and automatically unassign the<br /> I/O.

    The following table lists the supported I/Os by Bank type.

    |LVDS|—|X|A moderate-speed differential signaling system, in<br /> which the transmitter generates two different voltages<br /> which are compared at the receiver. It requires that one<br /> data bit be carried through two signal lines; therefore,<br /> you need two pins per input or output. It also requires<br /> an external resistor termination. The voltage swing<br /> between these two signal lines is approximately 350<br /> mV.|
    |LVDS33|—|X|LVDS for 3.3V|
    |BUSLVDS|—|X|2.5V BUSLVDS|
    |MLVDS|—|X|—|
    |MINILVDS|—|X|—|
    |RSDS|—|X|—|
    |LVPECL \(only for inputs\)|—|X|PECL is another differential I/O standard. It<br /> requires that one data bit is carried through two signal<br /> lines; therefore, two pins are needed per input or<br /> output. It also requires an external resistor<br /> termination. The voltage swing between these two signal<br /> lines is approximately 850 mV. When the power supply is<br /> 3.3V, it is commonly referred to as Low-Voltage PECL<br /> \(LVPECL\).|
    |PCI|—|—|\(Peripheral Component Interface\) Specifies support<br /> for both 33 MHz and 66 MHz PCI bus applications. It uses<br /> an LVTTL input buffer and a push-pull output buffer.<br /> With the aid of an external resistor, this I/O standard<br /> can be 5V compliant for most families.|
    |PCIX|—|—|\(Peripheral Component Interface Extended\) An enhanced<br /> version of the PCI specification that can support higher<br /> average bandwidth; it increases the speed that data can<br /> move within a computer from 66 MHz to 133 MHz. PCI-X is<br /> backward-compatible, which means that devices can<br /> operate at conventional PCI frequencies \(33 MHz and 66<br /> MHz\). PCI-X is also more Fault tolerant than<br /> PCI.|
    |HSTLI|X|X|\(High-Speed Transceiver Logic\) A general purpose,<br /> high-speed 1.5V bus standard \(EIA/JESD8-6\). It has four<br /> classes; Microchip® SoC supports<br /> Class I and II. It requires a differential amplifier<br /> input buffer and a push- pull output buffer.|
    |HSTLII|X|X|\(High-Speed Transceiver Logic\) A general purpose,<br /> high-speed 1.5V bus standard \(EIA/JESD8-6\). It has four<br /> classes; Microchip SoC supports Class I and II. It<br /> requires a differential amplifier input buffer and a<br /> push-pull output buffer.|

    |SSTL18II|X|X|\(Stub Series Terminated Logic for 1.8V\) A<br /> general-purpose 1.8V memory bus standard \(JESD8-9\). It<br /> has two classes; Microchip SoC supports both. It<br /> requires a differential amplifier input buffer and a<br /> push-pull output buffer.|

-pre\_emphasis Value
:   The pre-emphasis rate is the amount of rise or fall time an input signal<br /> takes to get from logic low to logic high or vice versa. It is commonly<br /> defined to be the propagation delay between 10% and 90% of the signal's<br /> voltage swing. Possible values are shown in the following table. The<br /> output buffer has a programmable slew rate for both high-to-low and<br /> low-to-high transitions. The low rate is incompatible with 3.3V PCI<br /> requirements.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |NONE|Sets to none \(default\)|
    |MIN|Sets to minimum|
    |MEDIUM|Sets to medium|
    |MAX|Sets to maximum|

-lpe Value
:   Sets the state at which your device exits from Low Power mode. Possible<br /> values are shown in the following table.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |OFF|Default; no LPE set|
    |Wake\_on\_Change|Exits from Low Power mode on change|
    |Wake\_on\_0|Exits from Low Power mode on 0|
    |Wake\_on\_1|Exits from Low Power mode on 1|

-ff\_io\_state Value
:   Preserves the previous state of the I/O. By default, all the I/Os become<br /> striated, when the device goes into Flash\*Freeze mode. \(A tristatable<br /> I/O is an I/O with three output states: high, low, and high-impedance.\)<br /> You can override this default using the`FF_IO_STATE`<br /> attributes. When you set this attribute to `LAST_VALUE`,<br /> the I/O remains in the same state in which it was functioning before the<br /> device went into Flash\*Freeze mode. Possible values are shown in the<br /> following table.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |TRISTATE|Sets the I/O to tri-state \(default\).|
    |LAST\_VALUE|Preserves the previous state of the I/O.|

-out\_drive Value
:   Sets the strength of the output buffer to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, or 20<br /> in mA, weakest to strongest. The list of I/O standards for which you can<br /> change the output drive and the list of values you can assign for each<br /> I/O standard is family-specific. Not all I/O standards have a selectable<br /> output drive strength. Also, each I/O standard has a different range of<br /> legal output drive strength values. The values you can choose from<br /> depend on which I/O standard you have specified for this command. See<br /> the Slew and Out\_drive Settings table under "Exceptions" in this topic<br /> for possible values. The following table lists the acceptable<br /> values.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |2|Sets the output drive strength to 2 mA|
    |4|Sets the output drive strength to 4 mA|
    |6|Sets the output drive strength to 6 mA|
    |8|Sets the output drive strength to 8 mA|
    |10|Sets the output drive strength to 10 mA|
    |12|Sets the output drive strength to 12 mA|
    |16|Sets the output drive strength to 16 mA|
    |20|Sets the output drive strength to 20 mA|

-slew Value
:   Sets the output slew rate. Slew control affects only the falling edges<br /> for some families. Slew control affects both rising and falling edges.<br /> Not all I/O standards have a selectable slew. Whether you can use the<br /> slew attribute depends on which I/O standard you have specified for this<br /> command.

    See the Slew and Out\_drive Settings table under Exceptions in this topic.<br /> The following table lists the acceptable values for the -slew<br /> attribute.

    |Value|Description|

    |MEDIUM|Sets the I/O slew to medium.|
    |MEDIUM\_FAST|Sets the I/O slew to medium fast.|
    |FAST|Sets the I/O slew to fast.|

-res\_pull Value
:   Allows you to include a weak resistor for either pull-up or pull-down of<br /> the input buffer or the output buffer. Not all I/O standards have a<br /> selectable resistor pull option. The following table shows the<br /> acceptable values for the -res\_pull attribute.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |up|Includes a weak resistor for pull-up of the input<br /> buffer.|
    |down|Includes a weak resistor for pull-down of the input<br /> buffer.|
    |none|Does not include a weak resistor. This is the default<br /> value.|

-schmitt\_trigger Value
:   Specifies whether this I/O has an input Schmitt Trigger. The Schmitt<br /> Trigger introduces hysteresis on the I/O input. This allows very slow<br /> moving or noisy input signals to be used with the part without false or<br /> multiple I/O transitions taking place in the I/O. The following table<br /> lists the acceptable values for the - schmitt\_trigger attribute.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |ON|Turns the Schmitt Trigger ON.|
    |OFF|Turns the Schmitt Trigger OFF.|

-in\_delay Value
:   Specifies whether this I/O has an input delay. You can specify an input<br /> delay between 0 and 63. The input delay is not a delay value but rather<br /> a selection from 0 to 63. The actual value is a function of the<br /> operating conditions and is automatically computed by the delay<br /> extractor when a timing report is generated. The following table lists<br /> the acceptable values for the -in\_delay attribute.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |OFF|This I/O does not have an input delay.|
    |0|Sets the input delay to 0.|
    |1|Sets the input delay to 1.|
    |2|Sets the input delay to 2.|
    |...|...|
    |63|Sets the input delay to 63.|

-odt\_static Value
:   On-Die Termination \(ODT\) is the technology where the termination resistor<br /> for impedance matching in transmission lines is located inside a<br /> semiconductor chip instead of on a printed circuit board. The following<br /> table lists the possible values.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |ON|Yes, the termination resistor for impedance matching<br /> is located inside the chip|
    |OFF|No, the termination resistor is on the printed<br /> circuit board|

-odt\_imp Value
:   ODT is the technology where the termination resistor for impedance<br /> matching in transmission lines is located inside a semiconductor chip<br /> instead of on a printed circuit board.

    Port Configuration \(PC\) bits are static configuration bits set during<br /> programming to configure the I/O\(s\) as per your choice. See your device<br /> data sheet for a full range of possible values.

-ff\_io\_avail Value
:   Indicates the I/O is available in Flash\*Freeze mode. The following table<br /> lists the possible values.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |yes|I/O is available in Flash\*Freeze mode.|
    |no|By default, I/O is unavailable in Flash\*Freeze<br /> mode.|

-pinname package\_pin
:   Specifies the package pin name\(s\) on which to place the I/O.

-fixed Value
:   Specifies whether the pin is locked or unlocked.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |yes|The location of this port is locked.|
    |no|The location of this port is unlocked.|

-out\_load Value

## set\_io \(RTG4 only\)

This PDC command sets the attributes of an I/O for RTG4 devices. You can use the `set_io` command to assign an I/O technology, the I/O attributes, place, or lock the I/O at a given pin location. There are three I/O Bank types available in RTG4; MSIOD, MSIO, and DDRIO.

**Important:** For the I/O Register combining option, use the set\_ioff command. See the [set\_ioff](GUID-B0082A32-AB1D-4BCA-8B59-F959035E9DE5.md#) command for more information.

```

[-slew value]\
[-res_pull value]\
[-schmitt_trigger value]\ 
[-input_delay value]\
[-odt_static value]\ 
[-odt_dynamic value]\
[-odt_imp value]\

```

### Arguments

The following section describes `set_io` \(RTG4 only\) arguments.

portname
:   Specifies the portname of the I/O macro.

-direction Value
:   Specifies the direction of the I/O ports. Valid values are input, output, and inout.

-iostd Value
:   Sets the I/O standard for this macro. Choosing a standard allows the software to set other attributes, such as the slew rate and output loading. If the voltage standard used with the I/O is not compatible with other I/Os in the I/O bank, then assigning an I/O standard to a port will invalidate its location and automatically unassign the I/O.

    The following table lists a list of supported I/Os by Bank type.
