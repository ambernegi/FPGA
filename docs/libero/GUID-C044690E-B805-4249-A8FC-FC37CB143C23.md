# Adjusting Clock Information

After you define all required constraints, including clock information, enter any<br /> information related to clock noise when such information is not or cannot be generated<br /> automatically by the tools. This is generally the case for external clock jitter<br /> information occurring at the primary inputs of the device. There can be multiple sources<br /> of clock jitter including:

-   Global jitter \(or internal system jitter\)
-   PLL/DLL jitter
-   External jitter

For more information about these types of jitter, see the appropriate product datasheets<br /> and documents.

Starting with Libero SoC v2022.1, the automatic computation of system clock jitter for<br /> Place &amp; Route and Static Timing Analysis was introduced to the design flow for<br /> PolarFire and PolarFire SoC devices. With this feature, you need only specify the clock<br /> jitter of any FPGA primary input using the `set_input_jitter` constraint.<br /> These jitter components are analyzed automatically, and a specific jitter value computed<br /> for each clock is passed on to the appropriate design flow steps. With the automatic<br /> clock jitter flow, you can add a margin to the estimated jitter of a clock using the<br /> `set_clock_uncertainty` constraint.

In rare cases or when instructed by user guides, you can use the<br /> `set_system_jitter` constraint to override the automatically computed<br /> global jitter value. System jitter is estimated based on the count of registers and RAM<br /> blocks in the synthesized netlist. A report similar to the following, detailing the<br /> jitter estimate, is generated upon completing the Place &amp; Route and Verify Timing<br /> steps.

The expanded timing analysis path reports include the clock jitter as an extra line<br /> item.

You can also provide the latency of a clock from its source outside the device to the<br /> primary input using the `set_clock_latency` constraint.

For more information about clock jitters, see the [PolarFire Family Clocking Resources User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/Microchip_PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Clocking_Resources_User_Guide_VB.pdf).

## Set a Clock Input Jitter Value

Use the `set_input_jitter` constraint to specify the peak-to-peak jitter<br /> value at the primary input of the clock \(see section [set\_input\_jitter](GUID-104B5D4C-AD1F-406A-B2DA-5B321AFBE506.md)\).

## Set a Clock Uncertainty Constraint

Use the **Set Clock Uncertainty Constraint** dialog<br /> box to<br /> <br /> set<br /> either the<br /> [Simple Clock Uncertainty](GUID-D35DA016-318E-44F3-8D1B-F551EF3343D8.md#) constraint or<br /> the<br /> [Clock To Clock Uncertainty](GUID-D35DA016-318E-44F3-8D1B-F551EF3343D8.md#) constraint from the<br /> **Type**<br /> drop-down menu. The default is<br /> [Simple Clock Uncertainty](GUID-D35DA016-318E-44F3-8D1B-F551EF3343D8.md#).

### Set Simple Clock Uncertainty Constraint

To open the **Set Clock Uncertainty Constraint**dialog box from the<br /> **Constraints**menu, choose **Clock Uncertainty**and select **Simple Clock Uncertainty**from the<br /> **Type**drop-down menu in **Set Clock Uncertainty Constraint** dialog box.

## Set Clock Source Latency Constraint

Use the clock source latency constraint to specify the delay from the clock generation point to<br /> the clock definition point in the design.

Clock source latency defines the delay between an external clock source and the definition pin of<br /> a clock.

You can specify both an "early" delay and a "late" delay for this latency, providing an<br /> uncertainty that the timing analyzer can use for propagating through its calculations.<br /> Rising and falling edges of the same clock can have different latencies. If only one<br /> clock source latency value is provided, the value is taken as the exact latency value<br /> for both rising and falling edges.

To specify a Clock Source Latency constraint, open the **Set Clock Source Latency Constraint** dialog box in one of the following four ways:

-   In the **Constraints Browser**, double-click **Clock Source Latency**.
-   Click the **Clock Source Latency Constraint** ![???](GUID-1C108EA1-1377-455A-A002-B373C075C8BC-low.jpg) icon.
-   From the **Constraints** menu, click **Clock Source Latency**.
-   Right-click any row of **Clock Latency Constraints Table** and click **Add Clock Source Latency**. The **Set Clock Source Latency Constraint** dialog box appears.

![???](GUID-10D38702-6F74-444C-9D4B-E78DF22E3BA3-low.jpg "Set Clock Source Latency Constraint Dialog Box")

The following table describes the **Set Clock Source Latency Constraint** dialog box options.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Clock Name or Source|To select the clock source, click the **Browse**<br /> button to open the **Choose the Clock Source Pin**<br /> dialog box.The only choice available for Pin Type is<br /> Clock Pins.|
|Late Rise|Specifies the largest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the rising<br /> clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its source.<br /> Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly optimistic<br /> analysis.|
|Late Fall|Specifies the largest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the<br /> falling clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its<br /> source. Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly<br /> optimistic analysis.|
|Early Rise|Specifies the smallest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the<br /> rising clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its<br /> source. Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly<br /> optimistic analysis.|
|Early Fall|Specifies the smallest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the<br /> falling clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its<br /> source. Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly<br /> optimistic analysis.|
|Falling same as rising|Specifies that the rising and falling clock edges have the same<br /> latency.|
|Early same as Late|<br /> Specifies that the clock source latency must be considered a single<br /> value, not a range from early to late.<br />|
|Comment|Enter a one-line comment to describe the clock source<br /> latency.|

## Set a Clock Group

To add or delete a<br /> clock<br /> group<br /> constraint, open the **Add Clock Groups Constraint** dialog box in<br /> one of the<br /> following<br /> ways:

-   From the **Constraints** menu, click **Clock Groups**.
-   In the **Constraints Browser**, double-click **Clock Groups**.
-   Right-click any row of **Clock Groups Constraints Table** and click **Add Clock Groups**.

Choose one of the following three clock group attributes for the<br /> clock group:-   **Logically Exclusive**: Use this setting for clocks that can exist physically on the device at the same time, but are logically exclusive \(for example, multiplexed clocks\).
-   **Physically Exclusive**: Use this setting for clocks that cannot exist physically on the device at the same time \(for example, multiple clocks defined on the same pin\).
-   **Asynchronous**: Use this setting when there are valid timing paths between the two clock groups, but the two clocks have no frequency or phase relationship and therefore these timing paths can be excluded from timing analysis.

Click **Add**to open a dialog<br /> box<br /> to add clocks to a clock group. In the<br /> **Available Pins** list, click the clocks, and<br /> then click **Add**to move them<br /> to<br /> the <br /> **Assigned Pins** list. Click<br /> **OK**.
