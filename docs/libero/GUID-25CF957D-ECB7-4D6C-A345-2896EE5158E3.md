# Adding a Macro

A macro is a basic low-level design object from the Macro Library in the<br /> Catalog. Right click a macro in the Design Tree and select **Load Selection** to add a macro. Adding a macro adds the instance with its<br /> connected nets to the view. The connected nets are always dashed yellow lines, even if they<br /> are not connected to any logic outside the view. Double clicking the net adds connections<br /> \(if any\) and turns the net from a dashed line to a solid line. A solid line for a net<br /> indicates that it is a user-added net.
