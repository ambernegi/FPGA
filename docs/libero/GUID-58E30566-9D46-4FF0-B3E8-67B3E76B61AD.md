# Use I/O Calibration from the Lane

The **Use I/O Calibration from the Lane** option supports the<br /> PolarFire and PolarFire SoC devices. This feature allows you to configure I/O to opt-out<br /> of recalibration. Use this feature either to delay or sequence calibration themselves or<br /> to account for VT impact on I/O performance. Default is OFF.

If you open an old design and you open the I/O Editor, you will not see this option. You<br /> must re-run compile to see the option.

**Note:** The **Use I/O Calibration from the Lane** option is not supported for ES and XT devices.
