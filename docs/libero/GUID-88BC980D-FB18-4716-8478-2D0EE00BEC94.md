# Manufacturing Flows

The following sections discuss the different types of manufacturing flows.

## HSM-based Manufacturing Flow

The HSM-based manufacturing process uses device-supported security protocols. For more<br /> information, refer to the [Secure Production Programming Solution \(SPPS\) User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/spps_ug.pdf).

The U-HSM allows the user to generate and use various encryption and pass keys. Cryptographical operations requiring those keys are executed inside the security boundaries of the HSM Module:

Operation support for the HSM-based Manufacturing Flow is as follows:

-   Key import, generation, and use under protection of the U-HSM and the M-HSM
-   Initial secure key injection into the device using the Authorization Code protocol
-   Secure data transmission between the U-HSM and the M-HSM
-   Overbuild protection
-   Device authentication
-   U-HSM verification of cryptographically sealed certificate of conformance \(CoC\) from the design programmed into the device
-   U-HSM verification programming job end certificates
-   â€‹Initiator and Upgrade programming job types
-   eNVM and sNVM client update
-   eNVM client selection
-   Security overwrite
-   Secure debug with SmartDebug tool

### HSM Server Requirements

In the HSM-based Manufacturing Flow, the Job Manager is configured to work with the U-HSM to<br /> generate the HSM Programming Job, and HSM Programming Jobs require the M-HSM for job<br /> execution. For more information about HSM servers, refer to the [Secure Production Programming Solution \(SPPS\) User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/spps_ug.pdf). For information about installation, refer to the [User HSM Installation and Setup User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/user_hsm_ug.pdf) for the U-HSM and the [Manufacturer HSM Installation and Setup User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/man_hsm_ug.pdf) for the M-HSM.

## Non-HSM Manufacturing Flow

Non-HSM Manufacturing Flow support by the Job Manager allows bitstream file and programming job generation outside of the Libero tool. The Job Manager supports the following operations for non-HSM Manufacturing Flow:

-   Initial key loading via KLK-protected bitstreams
-   Generate UEK1/UEK2/UEK3 encrypted update bitstreams
-   eNVM and sNVM client Update
-   eNVM client selection
-   Key value overwrite
-   Security overwrite
