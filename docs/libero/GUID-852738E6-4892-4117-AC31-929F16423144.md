# Create Programming Data from JDC File

New Programming Data is created using the `new_prog_data` Tcl command. It<br /> must be created within an existing or new Job Manager project.

When creating a new Programming Data entry, design data is copied from the external JDC<br /> file within the current project. After this step, the external JDC file is no longer<br /> used.

In the HSM flow, all keys are generated and controlled by the U-HSM. Therefore, in this<br /> flow, a new Programming Data must be associated with a keyset file created as shown in<br /> [Keyset File](GUID-FA65E854-D3BE-4A5E-9D59-1E8DA84DC48A.md). All<br /> cryptographic operations involving protected keys are executed inside the HSM module.<br /> For example, a Master bitstream is generated using the U-HSM and programmed via the<br /> Authorization Code protocol using the M-HSM.
