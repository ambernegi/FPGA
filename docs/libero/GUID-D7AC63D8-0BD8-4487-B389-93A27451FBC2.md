# Resolving top.v and Block Instantiations

Libero integrates the `top.v` file and block file if there is no definition for the block file in `top.v`. For example:

1.  Import the `top.v` \(**File &gt; Import HDL Sources Files**\) that contains instantiations but no definition of `<block1>`.
2.  Import `<block1>` \(**File &gt; Import&gt; Blocks**\).

Libero resolves the hierarchy and moves &lt;block1&gt; under `top.v`.
