# Getting Started

The following sections describe how to start using Libero SoC.

## Starting Libero SoC

When you start Libero SoC, the Welcome screen appears. In the left pane, links under **Projects** allow you to create a new Libero SoC project or open an existing one.

-   Clicking **New** starts the [New Project Creation Wizard](GUID-F9EBA308-305F-4288-8D09-CB856AA26995.md#). Use this wizard to create new Libero SoC projects.
-   Clicking **Open** opens an [existing Libero SoC project](GUID-F9EBA308-305F-4288-8D09-CB856AA26995.md#).

## Design Report

The **Design Report** tab lists the reports available for your design. Reports<br /> are added automatically as you move through design development.<br /> For example, timing reports are added when you run timing<br /> analysis on your design. Reports are updated each time you run a<br /> timing analysis.

To display the **Design Report** tab, click **Design &gt; Reports**.

If a report is not listed in the tab, you might have to create it manually. For example, you must<br /> start **Verify Power** manually before its report is available.

The following table lists the reports you can view in the **Design Report** tab.

### New Project Creation Wizard: Device Settings

Device settings vary by device family.

#### PolarFire Device Settings

For PolarFire, the Device Settings page is where you can set the core voltage, default<br /> I/O technology, and enable reserve pins for probes.

![](GUID-BEFB91CD-CBA8-4ACC-B42C-7C74586DC690-low.png "New Project Creation Wizard – Device Settings Page (PolarFire)")

The following table describes the fields in the Device Settings screen. After you<br /> complete the fields, click **Next** to go to the next screen or click<br /> **Finish** to create the new project by accepting all of the<br /> remaining default settings.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Core Voltage|Set the core voltage for your device.|
|Default I/O technology|Set all your I/Os to a default value. You can change the values<br /> for individual I/Os in the I/O Attribute Editor. The I/O Technology<br /> available is family-dependent.|
|Reserve pins for probes|Reserve your pins for probing if you intend to debug using<br /> SmartDebug. If unchecked, the I/Os can be used as General Purpose<br /> I/Os.|

#### SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2 Device Settings

For SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2, the Device Settings page is where you can set the device<br /> I/O technology, enable reserve pins for probes, set power supplies, and enable system<br /> controller suspended mode.

![](GUID-1E899519-314F-4AC4-AE87-0B295A355CCE-low.png "New Project Creation Wizard – Device Settings Page (SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2)")

The following table describes the fields in the Device Settings screen for SmartFusion 2<br /> and IGLOO 2. After you complete the fields, click **Next** to go to<br /> the next screen or click **Finish** to create the new project by<br /> accepting all of the remaining default settings.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Default I/O technology|Set all your I/Os to a default value. You can change the values<br /> for individual I/Os in the I/O Attribute Editor. The I/O Technology<br /> available is family-dependent.|
|Reserve pins for probes|Reserve your pins for probing if you intend to debug using<br /> SmartDebug. If unchecked, the I/Os can be used as General Purpose<br /> I/Os.|
|PLL supply voltage \(V\)|Set the voltage for the power supply that you plan to connect to<br /> all the PLLs in your design, such as MDDR, FDDR, SERDES, and<br /> FCCC.|
|VDD Supply Ramp Time|Power-up management circuitry is designed into every SmartFusion<br /> 2 and IGLOO 2 FPGA. These circuits ensure easy transition from the<br /> powered-off state to the powered-up state of the device. The<br /> SmartFusion 2, IGLOO 2, and RTG4 system controller is responsible<br /> for systematic power-on reset whenever the device is powered on or<br /> reset. All I/Os are held in a high-impedance state by the system<br /> controller until all power supplies are at their required levels and<br /> the system controller has completed the reset sequence.The<br /> power-on reset circuitry in SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2 devices<br /> requires the VDD and VPP supplies to ramp<br /> monotonically from 0 V to the minimum recommended operating<br /> voltage within a predefined time. There is no sequencing<br /> requirement on VDD and VPP. Four ramp rate options are available<br /> during design generation: 50 μs, 1 ms, 10 ms, and 100 ms. Each<br /> selection represents the maximum ramp rate to apply to VDD and<br /> VPP.Device information \(such as Die, Package, and Speed\)<br /> can be modified later in the Project Settings dialog<br /> box.|
|System controller suspended mode|Suspends operation of the System Controller. Checking this box<br /> places the System Controller in a reset state when the device is<br /> powered up. This suspends all system services from being performed.<br /> For a list of system services for SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2, see the<br /> System Controller User's Guide for your device.|

#### RTG4 Device Settings

For RTG4, the Device Settings page is where you can set the default I/O technology and<br /> activate reserve pins for probes and enable single event transient mitigation.

![](GUID-F3A3115B-18ED-407A-B63E-C19CEF7EDA9B-low.png "New Project Creation Wizard – Device Settings Page (RTG4)")

The following table describes the fields in the Device Settings screen for RTG4. After<br /> you complete the fields, click **Next** to go to the next screen or<br /> click **Finish** to create the new project by accepting all of the<br /> remaining default settings.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Default I/O technology|Set all your I/Os to a default value. You can change the values<br /> for individual I/Os in the I/O Attribute Editor. The I/O Technology<br /> available is family-dependent.|
|Reserve pins for probes|Reserve your pins for probing if you intend to debug using<br /> SmartDebug. If unchecked, the I/Os can be used as General Purpose<br /> I/Os.|
|Enable Single Event Transient mitigation|Controls the mitigation of Single Event Transient \(SET\) in the<br /> FPGA fabric. When this box is checked, SET filters are turned on<br /> globally to help mitigate radiation-induced transients. By default,<br /> this box is not checked.|

### New Project Creation Wizard: Design Template \(SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2\)

The Design Template page is where you can use Libero SoC’s built-in template to automate<br /> your SmartFusion 2 or IGLOO 2 design process. The template uses the System Builder tool<br /> for system-level design or the Microcontroller Subsystem \(MSS\) in your design. Both will<br /> speed up the design process.

![???](GUID-519EEA28-2835-4DEB-B1AB-DBB324DA3752-low.jpg "New Project Creation Wizard – Design Template Page")

The following table describes the fields in the Device Template screen. After you<br /> complete the fields, click **Next** to go to the Add HDL Sources page<br /> or click **Finish** to create the new project by accepting all of the<br /> remaining default settings.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|None|Select if you do not want to use a design template.|
|Create a System Builder based design|Use System Builder to generate your top-level design.|
|Create a Microcontroller \(MSS\) based design|Instantiate a Microcontroller \(MSS\) in your design. The version of<br /> the MSS cores available in your vault is displayed. Select the version<br /> you desire.|
|Use Standalone Initialization for MDDR/FDDR/SERDES<br /> Peripherals|Check if you want to create your own peripheral initialization logic<br /> in SmartDesign for each design peripheral \(MDDR/FDDR/SERDES\). When<br /> checked, System Builder does not build the peripherals initialization<br /> logic for you. Stand-alone initialization is useful if you want to make<br /> the initialization logic of each peripheral separate from and<br /> independent of each other.|
|Instantiate System Builder/MSS component in a SmartDesign on<br /> creation|Uncheck if you are using this project to create System Builder or MSS<br /> components and do not plan on using them in a SmartDesign based design.<br /> This is especially useful for design flows where the System Builder or<br /> MSS components are stitched in a design using HDL.|

### New Project Creation Wizard: Add HDL Source Files

The Add HDL Source Files screen is where you can add HDL design source files to your<br /> Libero SoC project. The HDL source files can be imported or linked to the Libero SoC<br /> project.
