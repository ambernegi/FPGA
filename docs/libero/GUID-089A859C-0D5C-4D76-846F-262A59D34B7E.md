# Adding a Net

Right click a net in the Design Tree and select **Load Selection** to add a net to the view. Adding a net to the view adds a solid<br /> line net to the view \(unless you cancel early\), including all the instances and ports the<br /> net is connected to. The added net is selected in the view.

Nets that span multiple pages can be followed through the right click menu<br /> item **Follow Net to Page\#** to go to different pages that the net is<br /> on.
