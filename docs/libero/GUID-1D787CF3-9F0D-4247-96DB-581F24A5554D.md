# Electrical Specifications

This chapter describes the FlashPro electrical specifications.

## FlashPro6

FlashPro6 is a JTAG-based programmer for Flash-based Microchip devices.

The FlashPro6 output is supplied through a connector, to which a detachable 10-pin cable is<br /> fitted. The connector on the FlashPro6 unit is a 2x5, RA male Header connector that is<br /> manufactured by 3M and has a manufacturer’s part number of N2510-5002-RB. This is a<br /> standard 2x5, 0.1-pitch keyed connector. In your board, use the 10-pin header, Samtec<br /> P/N HTST-105-01-L-DV-A, or equivalent.

The following figure shows the signals on the pins of the FlashPro6 10-pin connector.

**Note:** All ground pins must be connected. The rectangular shape shows connections on the programmer itself. Arrows show current flow towards or from the rectangular programmer.

The following table lists the signals.

</table>Some designers of high-integrity military and avionic boards may arrange their boards so that<br /> TRST is tied to ground through a weak pull-down resistor. The purpose of this is to hold<br /> the JTAG state machine in a Reset state by default, so that even with TCK oscillating,<br /> some sudden ion bombardment or other electrical event will not suddenly throw the JTAG<br /> state machine into an unknown state. If your design also uses a weak pull-down resistor<br /> on TRST on your board, enabling the “Drive TRST” flag will be required to force the JTAG<br /> state machine out of reset, to permit programming to take place. With most boards, there<br /> is no need to select this flag.

## FlashPro5

FlashPro5 is a JTAG- and a SPI-based programmer for Flash-based Microchip devices.

The FlashPro5 output is supplied via a connector to which a detachable 10-pin cable is fitted.<br /> The connector on the FlashPro5 unit is a 2x5, RA male Header connector that is<br /> manufactured by AMP and has a manufacturer’s part number of 103310-1. This is a standard<br /> 2x5, 0.1-pitch keyed connector. Use the 10-pin right-angle header, AMP P/N 103310-1<br /> \(DigiKey P/N A26285-ND\) for FlashPro4 and use the 10-pin straight header, AMP P/N<br /> 103308-1 \(DigiKey P/N A26267-ND\) for the straight version.

The following figure shows the signals on the FlashPro5 10-pin connector pins.
