# I/O State in Flash\*Freeze Mode

By default, all I/Os become tri-stated when the device goes into<br /> Flash\*Freeze mode. You can override this default behavior by setting one of the following<br /> two values:

-   LAST\_VALUE—When set to this value, it preserves the previous state of the I/O. This means the I/O remains in the same state in which it had functioned before the device went into Flash\*Freeze mode.
-   LAST VALUE\_WP—When set to this value, it preserves the last value with weak pull-up.

**Note:** This I/O attribute is applicable for SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2 families only.
