# Introduction

Libero® System-on-Chip \(SoC\) software provides a fully integrated Field<br /> Programmable Gate Array \(FPGA\) design environment. However, a few users might want to use<br /> third-party synthesis and simulation tools outside the Libero SoC environment. Libero can now<br /> be integrated into the FPGA design environment. It is recommended to use Libero SoC to manage<br /> the entire FPGA design flow.

This user guide describes the Custom Flow, a process to integrate Libero as a part of the larger FPGA design flow.

## Supported Device Families

The following table lists the device families that Libero SoC supports. However, some information in this guide might only apply to a specific family of devices. In this case, such information is clearly identified.

|Device Family|Description|
