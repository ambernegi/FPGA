# SPPS Ecosystem

SPPS includes the following tools and servers \(see [Figure   1](GUID-9CB51621-8842-4683-A4F7-F1AB8745CAEE.md#FIG_FNC_4GQ_SNB)\).

-   **Libero Design Tool**—the design engineer creates and exports a Libero design in a Job Data Container \(JDC\) file.
-   **Job Manager Tool**—used by the OE to generate an HSM or non-HSM programming job using a JDC file received from Libero. The Job Manager also allows the OE to modify certain design features, such as eNVM content and security settings.
-   **FlashPro Express**—used during production to program the device from programming jobs created by the Job Manager tool.
-   **U-HSM Server**—used by the Job Manager to create secured jobs for HSM flow. It also allows the OE to test-execute programming job created with FlashPro Express. The Job Manager uses

    the U-HSM to validate<br /> results of the programming job execution.

-   **M-HSM Server**—used by FlashPro Express to generate protocol data and generate per-device key values \(which are derived from the device serial number and the base values of the user key\) during programming. The M-HSM enforces overbuild protection.
-   **Firmware Design Tools**—firmware developers can generate new firmware images that can be sent to the OE and updated inside the Job Manager through the eNVM update feature.
