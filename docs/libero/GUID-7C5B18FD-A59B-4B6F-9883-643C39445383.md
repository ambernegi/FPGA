# Slew

The slew rate is the amount of rise or fall time an input signal takes to get from logic<br /> low to logic high or vice versa. It is commonly defined to be the propagation delay between<br /> 10% and 90% of the signal's voltage swing. The I/O Editor supports slew rate control in<br /> non-differential output mode.

Turning the slew rate on \(either by setting it to ON in the I/O Editor or in a PDC file\)<br /> results in a slew rate limited for the I/O standard in the device. When the value for SLEW<br /> in the I/O Editor or PDC command is \(chosen\) OFF, the device uses the maximum slew rate for<br /> the I/O standard to reduce the impact of simultaneous switching noise \(SSN\). Not all I/O<br /> standards support the slew rate control.

**Note:** Slew rate control is not available in PolarFire HSIO buffers. However, these buffers have built-in PVT- compensated slew rate controllers for optimized signal integrity.
