# PolarFire SoC MSS Configurator v2025.1 Welcome Page

The PolarFire® SoC Microprocessor Subsystem \(MSS\) Configurator is a<br /> software tool to configure the PolarFire SoC microprocessor subsystem. The MSS<br /> configuration is imported by the Libero® SoC Design Suite in the<br /> FPGA design flow and SoftConsole in the embedded design flow.

## What's New in PolarFire SoC Standalone MSS Configurator v2025.1

MSS\_DDR 16-bit width with ECC enabled: Updated MSS Configurator component XML to<br /> enable correct ECC byte-lane and ensure successful DDR memory training.

**Note:** MPFS HAL versions later than v2.3.105 are required from the [PolarFire SoC GitHub](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/platform) organization to use this change.

## Getting Started

-   To start configuring a new MSS subsystem, select **New** from the project menu.
-   To open an existing configuration file \(`.cfg`\), select **Open** from the project menu.
-   To save the current configuration of the MSS subsystem, select **Save** or **Save As** from the project menu.
-   To generate the MSS component file \(`.cxz`\), select **Generate** from the project menu after configuring the MSS subsystem. The MSS component file can be imported into Libero SoC tool. MSS configuration \(`.cfg`\) file will also be generated along with XML file.
-   To close the current configuration file \(`.cfg`\) select **Close** from the project menu.

    **Important:** The current configuration file needs to be closed before starting a new configuration.


## Working Modes

-   **Batch Mode**: PolarFire SoC MSS Configurator tool can be executed in batch mode. For example:

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_KLB_ZFY_25B}
    pfsoc_mss -GENERATE -CONFIGURATION_FILE:<absolute or relative path for configuration file name (.cfg)> -OUTPUT_DIR:<absolute or relative path for output directory> -EXPORT_HDL:<true/false> -LOGFILE:<absolute or relative path for logfile file name>
    ```

    **Important:** The argument `-GENERATE` must be specified to generate the MSS component and the XML file in batch mode. `-EXPORT_HDL` and `-LOGFILE` are optional arguments.

-   **GUI Mode**: PolarFire SoC MSS Configurator tool can be opened in the graphical user interface \(GUI\) mode for a particular configuration file. For example:

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_MLB_ZFY_25B}
    pfsoc_mss -CONFIGURATION_FILE:<absolute or relative path for configuration file name (.cfg)>
    
    ```

### Licensing

Libero software and DirectC license orders are now supported through Microchip<br /> purchasing portal. Most of the software tools and FPGA IP cores are freely<br /> available but some high-value IP cores and resources needed to work with<br /> high-density FPGAs require paid licenses. For more information, see [Licensing](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/licensing).
