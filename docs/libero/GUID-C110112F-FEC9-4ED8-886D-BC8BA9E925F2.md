# Installing a Node-Locked License

The Libero SoC Design Suite node-locked license is supported only on Windows operating systems.

The following steps describe how to install a node-locked license.

**Attention:** For UNIX and Linux installations, skip this step and go directly to the [Installing a Floating License](GUID-308F9775-D342-456D-964F-537CD6DE0D1E.md) section.

1.  Create a folder named FlexLM in a root directory \(for example, `c:\FlexLM`\), and then save the `License.dat` file in the created folder.

    **Attention:** The license file will be attached to the automatically generated email. Alternatively, you can download the license file from the License page at [https://www.microchipdirect.com/fpga-software-products](https://www.microchipdirect.com/fpga-software-products).

2.  Open the **Start** menu, search for **Environment Variables**.

    The **Environment Variables** dialog appears.

3.  In the dialog, under **User Variables**, perform the appropriate step:

    If `LM_LICENSE_FILE` appears in the dialog:

    1.  Select the variable, and then select **Edit**.

    2.  Append `<drive directory>\folder\License.dat` to the existing value, separating them with a semicolon.

    3.  Select **OK** to save your edits and exit the dialog.

    If `LM_LICENSE_FILE` does not appear in the dialog:

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  Set the **Variable Name** to `LM_LICENSE_FILE`.

    3.  Set the **Variable Value** to `<drive directory>\Folder\License.dat`.

    4.  Select **OK** to save your edits and exit the dialog.

4.  The installation process is complete. You can start using the installed Libero SoC Design Suite tools.

5.  Start Libero SoC Design Suite and verify its correct operation.

    **Attention:** In the unlikely event you encounter an issue, create a [Microchip Support Case](https://microchip.my.site.com/s/).
