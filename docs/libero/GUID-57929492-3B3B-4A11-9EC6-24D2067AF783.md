# Checking an IRS Net Assignment to a Routing Region

MSVT checks whether all IRS nets of a design are assigned to a routing region. MSVT lists all instances of IRS nets that are not assigned to a routing region in the `Following IRS nets are not constrained by any routing region` section of the report. If all of the IRS nets are assigned to an IRS routing region, the MSVT report omits this section.

**Note:** This is an informational section meant to identify nets that are not assigned to IRS region and does not cause MSVT to fail.

## MSVT Output Report
