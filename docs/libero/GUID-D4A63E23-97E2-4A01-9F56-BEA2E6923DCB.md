# User Cryptoprocessor

The FIC-4 is a dedicated interface for the User Cryptoprocessor. FIC-4 provides two 32-bit AHB-Lite bus interfaces between the User Cryptoprocessor and the FPGA fabric.

-   In one interface, the FPGA fabric acts as the initiator and the User Cryptoprocessor acts as target.
-   In other interface, the DMA controller acts as the initiator of the User Cryptoprocessor and has a target in the FPGA fabric.

The following table describes the simulation support for each crypto mode.

|Crypto Mode|Description|Simulation Support|
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
|MSS|The Crypto block is available to the MSS only.|Yes, streaming interface is supported.|
|Fabric|The Crypto block is available to the FPGA fabric only.|The AHB interface is exposed to FPGA fabric, simulation can be performed with Crypto.|
|Shared-MSS|Initially, the Crypto block is connected to the MSS and can be requested by the FPGA fabric.|The AHB interface is exposed and simulation can be performed with Crypto in fabric mode and streaming interface in MSS mode.|
|Shared-Fabric|Initially, the Crypto block is connected to the FPGA fabric and can be requested by the MSS.|The AHB interface is exposed and simulation can be performed with Crypto in fabric mode and streaming interface in MSS mode.|

The signals used to change the ownership from MSS to Fabric and vice versa are listed in the following table.

|Signal|Direction|Description|
|------|---------|-----------|
|Crypto\_fab\_request|F2H|Fabric request or is using the Crypto block.|
|Crypto\_mss\_request|H2F|MSS request or is using the Crypto block.|
|Crypto\_fab\_release|F2H|Fabric released the core.|
|Crypto\_mss\_release|Internal|MSS released the core.|
|Crypto\_fab\_owner|H2F|Indicates that the Fabric owns the core, and the fabric interface is enabled.|
|Crypto\_mss\_owner|H2F|Indicates that the MSS owns the core and the fabric interface is disabled.|

The Crypto block can be owned by either the fabric or MSS and the ownership can be transferred during operation. Transfer of ownership requires co-operation between the MSS and Fabric designs.

## Ownership Finite State Machine

The ownership FSM runs on the SCB clock that is independent of the FPGA fabric and MSS clocking systems. During switchover events, the FSM will request that the SCB clock runs at 80 MHz rather than at 1 MHz idle rate.

**Parent topic:**[Simulation Flow](GUID-C6E6D8E0-C726-46F1-ADEA-D21BA9D5101E.md)

## Fabric Mode

In Fabric mode, streaming interface is not enabled. You can perform read and write<br /> operation using the AHB interface.

**Important:** For more information about using Crypto block and performing simulation, see the [PolarFire FPGA Implementing Data Security using UserCrypto Processor Application Note](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNotes/Microchip_PolarFire_FPGA_Implementing_Data_Security_Using_User_Cryptoprocessor_Application_Note_AC464_V11.pdf).

## MSS Mode

In MSS mode, only streaming interface simulations are supported. AHB interface is towards MSS and<br /> will not be exposed to Fabric. Libero SoC generates<br /> `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm` file which can used to perform AXI<br /> transaction with crypto engine. Streaming interface is also called direct transfer<br /> interface. The direct transfer interface comprises of unidirectional data input and<br /> output ports, and associated handshakes for data transfer operations. Direct transfers<br /> are performed when explicitly commanded by the direct transfer instructions.

### DXI: Direct Transfer Block In

The DXI instruction copies a block of data from the direct transfer input port, **xwdata**, to the destination register starting at the location determined by the IA/ASEL/AOP field. During the execution of the DXI instruction, the value of the BOP field will be output on the **xwaddr** output port. The length of the transfer is given by the ALEN register. Transfers are controlled by the **xenable**/**xinaccept** handshake and the DXI instruction will run until the specified number of words have been transferred.

#### Direct Transfer Input Interface Operation and Timing

The direct transfer input transaction occurs as the transmitting party drives **xwdata**and asserts **xenable**. The Crypto block indicates that it will accept the data on the next rising edge of **hclk**by asserting the **xinaccept**signal. If the **xinaccept**signal is negated, then the **xenable**and **xwdata** inputs will be ignored by the Crypto block. If the direct transfer input port is not used, the **xenable**signal should be tied high and the **xwdata**signal should be tied to a known value.

![](GUID-76CB2E63-90E0-4193-9208-7F6C65595421-low.png "Crypto DXI Signal Waveform")

To perform DXI operation in simulation, you need to provide write data on **xwdata** port of crypto engine. The following steps are needed to perform a DXI transaction.

Steps to be followed in `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm` file:

1.  Declare “CSR\_MAIN” with the address

    Example:

    ```
    memmap CSR_MAIN 0x00007f80;
    memmap LIR_BASE_ADDR 0x00004000;
    ```

2.  Give the purge, soft reset and out of soft reset by writing the following commands.

    ```
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000020 // set purge
    wait 300
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000001 // soft reset
    wait 300
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000000 // out of reset
    wait 300
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000002 // clear complete
    ```

3.  Once the above steps are completed, configure some of the registers to perform the DXI transactions. The following steps are the sequence to perform DXI transactions.

    ```
    # **Update Instructions**
    # Update Instructions in LIR registers, LIR register Address Range is from 4000h-5FFCh
    # set the number of instruction user need to perform, set the number of instruction in command with SLN as opcode at bits [31:26] and number of instructions at bit [22:13]
    write w 0x4000 0x0 0x3010e1ce # SLN 0x087,0x1ce
    # write the opcode in bits[31:26] and address at [22:13], [9:0] is the address which user is able to see same address on xwaddr port while performing DXI transaction.
    # opcode of DXI is 0XE. 
    write w 0x4008 0x0 0x3846a13f # DXI BER:0x235, BER:0x13f
    write w 0x400c 0x0 0x74040800 # HLRA
    # write the csrmain register to Start computation command bit
    write w 0x7F80 0x0 0x10 
    #write the csrmain register to Write-only clear CMPLT flag bit
    write w 0x00007f80 0x0 00000002
    #read the csr main register 
    read w 0x00007f80 0x0 #
    wait 300 
    ```

4.  Once the above steps are completed, wait for some time and read the data from the address. Address can be calculated as DXI BER X 4 \(0x235 X 4 =08d4\).

    You can read the data from address 0x8d4 till the length which was given in SLN register using 32\_bit /64 bit transactions.

    You can get the same data that was given on the **xwdata** port when you do a read transaction in the BFM.

    ```
    #Read data at BER:0x235
    set offset 0x08d0
    loop CNT 1 68 1
    read64 w offset 0x0
    set offset offset + 8
    endloop
    ```


Steps to be followed in the testbench:

1.  Once the crypto engine setup is done for DXI transfer by bfm initiator, you will receive `CRYPTO_XINACCEPT_M2F` signal as high and `CRYPTO_XWADDR_M2F` as “13f”\(which you set in the DXI execution command\). Assert `CRYPTO_XENABLE_F2M` and provide the data on `CRYPTO_XWDATA_F2M`.
2.  Dessert the `CRYPTO_XENABLE_F2M` when `CRYPTO_XINACCEPT_M2F` is zero.

    The following code block shows the example commands used in a design.

### DXO: Direct Transfer Block Out

The DXO instruction copies a block of data to the direct transfer output port, **xrdata**, from the source register starting at the location determined by the IB/BSEL/BOP field. During the execution of the DXO instruction, the value of the AOP field will be output on the **xraddr** output port. The length of the transfer is given by the ALEN register. Transfers are controlled by the **xvalidout**/**xoutack** handshake, and the DXO instruction runs until the specified number of words have been transferred.

#### Direct Transfer Output Interface Operation and Timing

The direct transfer output transaction occurs as the rising edge of **hclk**, data is presented on **xrdata**, and the **xvalidout**signal is asserted. The receiving party indicates receipt of the data by asserting the **xoutack**signal, which is sampled on the rising edge of **hclk**by the Crypto block. The **xoutack**signal may be asserted on the same clock cycle that **xvalidout**is asserted or any subsequent clock cycle. The following waveform shows an example where the **xoutack**is asserted one cycle after **xvalidout**is asserted. If **xvalid-out**is negated, then the **xoutack**signal is ignored.

![](GUID-A232F91B-96B0-472C-AE2A-6FAB47DDA0F4-low.png "Crypto DXO Signal Waveform")

Following are the steps that need to be followed to perform DXO transaction.

Steps to be followed in `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm` file:

1.  Declare “`CSR_MIAN`” with the address

    Example:

    ```
    memmap CSR_MAIN 0x00007f80;
    memmap LIR_BASE_ADDR 0x00004000; 
    ```

2.  Give the purge, soft reset and out of soft reset by writing the following commands.

    ```
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000020 // set purge
    wait 300
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000001 // soft reset
    wait 300
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000000 // out of reset
    wait 300
    write w CSR_MAIN 0x0 0x00000002 // clear complete
    ```

3.  Once the above steps are completed write the at address that you are writing along with DXO op code and the number of instructions that you are giving in SLN command.

    ```
    write w 0x0b18 0x0 0x290cadba
    write w 0x0b1c 0x0 0x85b3d5b1
    .
    .
    .
    .
    write w 0x0c18 0x0 0x8f7f3ff6
    ```

4.  After writing the write data, configure some of the registers to perform the DXO transactions. Perform DXO transactions in the following sequence.

    ```
    #Provide the number of instruction user need to perform, set the number of instructions in command with 
    #SLN as opcode at [31:26] and address at bit [22:13]
    write w 0x5000 0x0 0x300820a7 # SLN 0x041,0x0a7
    # write the opcode in bits[31:26] and address where user need to write data at [9:0].
    [22:13] is the address which user can see on xraddr while performing DXO transaction.
    # opcode of DXO is 0XF.
    write w 0x5004 0x0 0x3c6342c6
    # DXO BER:0x31a, BER:0x2c6
    write w 0x5008 0x0 0x74040800
    # HLRA is the compulsory command we need to write
    #write the csrmain register to Start computation command bit
    write w 0x7F80 0x0 0x10
    # to read the status of the transaction
    read w 0x80000000 0x0
    ```

5.  You will get the read data on **xrdata** port which is accessible to fabric.

Steps to be followed in the testbench:

1.  Once the crypto engine setup is done for DXO transfer by `bfm` initiator you will receive the `CRYPTO_XVALIDOUT_M2F` signal as high. Assert `CRYPTO_XOUTACK_F2M` and read data on `CRYPTO_XRDATA_F2M`.
2.  De-assert the `CRYPTO_XOUTACK_F2M` when `CRYPTO_XVALIDOUT_M2F` is zero.
3.  You can get the same data that you wrote from the `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm` file.

The following code block shows the example commands for DXO interface used in a design.

```

## Shared MSS Mode

By default, Crypto is in MSS mode. In this mode, streaming interface simulations are supported.<br /> You can perform the same operations which are performed in MSS mode.

To change Crypto from MSS mode to Fabric mode the following sequence needs to be followed.

### Steps to be followed in `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm` file

Request crypto controller from MSS mode to Fabric mode by writing `mss_release =1` and<br /> `mss request =’b0;`. You can also perform this operation by writing<br /> `IOWRITE` is set to 2 in<br /> `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm`.

```
IOWRITE  0x00000002   
```

### **Steps to be followed in the testbench**

Once you have requested the Crypto controller from `user.bfm` file, assert<br /> `CRYPTO_REQUEST_F2M` and deassert `CRYPTO_RELEASE_F2M` to change<br /> the mode from MSS mode to Fabric mode.

After changing into Fabric mode, you can perform the same operations which are performed in<br /> Fabric mode and MSS interface will be disconnected from Crypto block.

## Shared Fabric Mode

By default, Crypto is in Fabric mode. You can perform the same operations which are performed in<br /> Fabric mode. The following steps are to change Crypto from Fabric mode to MSS mode.

### Steps to be followed in `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm` file

Request the Crypto controller to change from Fabric mode to MSS mode by writing `mss_release =0` and `mss request =1’b1;`. You can also perform this operation by<br /> writing `IOWRITE` is set to 1 in<br /> `PFSOC_MSS_FIC4_user.bfm`.

```
IOWRITE  0x00000001
