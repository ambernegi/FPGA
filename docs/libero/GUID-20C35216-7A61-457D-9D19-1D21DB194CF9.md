# Preventing Overbuilding

The overbuild protection mechanism allows the user to restrict the number of devices programmed using a specific design. The maximum number of allowed devices and the count of already programmed devices are stored in the physical HSM module, and cannot be physically cloned. The HSM module enforces overbuild protection during programming as a part of security protocols execution.
