# Glossary

The following glossary defines terms in this user guide.

<br />

|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Arrival time|Actual time in nanoseconds when data arrives at a sink pin when<br /> considering the propagation delays across the path.|
|Asynchronous|Two signals that are not related to each other. Signals not<br /> related to the clock are usually asynchronous.|
|Capture edge|The clock edge that triggers the capture of data at the end point<br /> of a path.|
|Clock|A periodic signal that captures data into sequential<br /> elements.|
|Critical path|A path with the maximum delay between a starting point and an end<br /> point. In the presence of a clock constraint, the worst critical<br /> path between registers in this clock domain is the path with the<br /> worst slack.|
|Data timing analysis|The standard method for verifying design functionality and<br /> performance. Both pre-layout and post-layout timing analysis can be<br /> performed via the SDF interface.|
|Exception|See timing exception.|
|Explicit clock|Clock sources that can be traced back unambiguously from the<br /> clock pin of the registers they deserve, including the output of a<br /> DLL or PLL.|
|Filter|A set of limitations applied to object names in timing analysis<br /> to generate target specific sets.|
|Launch edge|The clock edge that triggers the release of data from a starting<br /> point to be captured by another clock edge at an end point.|
|Minimum period|Timing characteristic of a path between two registers. It<br /> indicates how fast the clock runs when this path is the most<br /> critical one. The minimum period value takes into consideration both<br /> the skew and the setup on the receiving register.|
|Parallel paths|Paths that run in parallel between a given source and sink<br /> pair.|
|Path|A sequence of elements in the design that identifies a logical<br /> flow starting at a source pin and ending at a sink pin.|
|Path details|An expansion of the path that shows all the nets and cells<br /> between the source pin and the sink pin.|
|Path set|A collection of paths.|
|Paths list|Same as path set.|
|Post-layout|The state of the design after you run Layout. In post-layout, the<br /> placement and routing information are available for the whole<br /> design.|
|Potential clock|Pins or ports connected to the clock pins of sequential elements<br /> that the STA tool cannot determine whether they are is enabled<br /> sources or clock sources. This type of clock is generally associated<br /> with the use of gated clocks.|
|Pre-layout|The state of the design before you run Layout. In pre-layout, the<br /> placement and routing information are not available.|
|Recovery time|The amount of time before the active clock edge when the<br /> de-activation of asynchronous signals is not allowed.|
|Removal time|The amount of time after the active clock edge when the<br /> de-activation of asynchronous signals is not allowed.|
|Required time|The time when data must be at a sink pin to avoid being in<br /> violation.|
|Requirement|See timing requirement.|
|Scenario \(timing constraints scenario\)|Set of timing constraints defined by the user.|
|Setup time|The time in nanoseconds relative to a clock edge during which the<br /> data at the input to a sequential element must remain<br /> stable.|
|Sink pin|The pin located at the end of the timing path. This pin is<br /> usually the one where arrival time and required time are evaluated<br /> for path violation.|
|Skew|The difference between the clock insertion delay to the clock pin<br /> of a sink register and the insertion delay to the clock pin of a<br /> source register.|
|Slack|The difference between the arrival time and the required time at<br /> a specific pin, generally at the data pin of a sequential<br /> component.|
|Slew rate|The time needed for a signal to transition from one logic level<br /> to another.|
|Source pin|The pin located at the beginning of a timing path.|
|STA|See static timing analysis.|
|Standard delay format \(SDF\)|A standard file format used to store design data suited for<br /> back-annotation.|
|Static timing analysis|An efficient technique to identify timing violations in a design<br /> and to ensure that all timing requirements are met. It is well<br /> suited for traditional synchronous designs. The main advantages are<br /> that it does not require input vectors, and it exclusively covers<br /> all possible paths in the design in a relatively short<br /> run-time.|
|Synopsys design constraint \(SDC\)|A standard file format for timing constraints. SDC is a Tcl-based<br /> format used by Synopsys tools to specify the design intent,<br /> including the timing and area constraints for a design. Micrchip SoC<br /> tools use a subset of the SDC format to capture supported timing<br /> constraints. You can import or export an SDC file from the Designer<br /> software. Any timing constraint that you can enter using Designer<br /> tools, can also be specified in an SDC file.|
|Timing constraint|A requirement or limitation on the design to be satisfied during<br /> the design implementation.|
|Timing exception|An exception to a general requirement usually applied on a subset<br /> of the objects on which the requirement is applied.|
|Timing requirement|A constraint on the design usually determined by the<br /> specifications at the system level.|
|Virtual clock|A virtual clock is a clock with no source associated to it. It is<br /> used to describe clocks outside the FPGA that have an impact on the<br /> timing analysis inside the FPGA. For example, if the I/Os are<br /> synchronous to an external clock.|
|Wire Load Model \(WLM\)|A timing model used in pre-layout to estimate a net delay based<br /> on the fan-out.|
