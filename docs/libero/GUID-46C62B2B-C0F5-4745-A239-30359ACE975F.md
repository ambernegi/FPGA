### Changes That Address Important Issues

#### RTG4

- PLL calibration updates for RTG4FCCCECALIB v2.2.100, FDDR v2.0.200, and SerDes v2.0.200 cores:
  - - Reduced VCO speed-up ratio to improve PLL lock stability as operating conditions reach cold temperatures
- Reduced dwell time at high VCO frequency for continued successful PCIe endpoint enumeration with newer generation host CPUs
- FDDR 16-bit and 8-bit width modes with ECC enabled:
  - Updated IP core top-level DQ\_ECC port bit mapping to device package pin FDDR\_DQ\_ECC\[\#\] for proper ECC functionality

  - Support for ZQCS command
  - Re-inititialization enabled to restart DDR training
  - Fast simulation training IP
  - Removal of ODT activation setting on read
