# L2-LIM Access

Fabric initiator might try to get access to the L2-LIM memory and initiate data transfer between<br /> LIM and fabric. To mimic this, 1920 KB of memory is attached to S8 of the AXI switch. In<br /> simulation, this memory is not partitioned as per the configured WAY in MSS<br /> configurator. Only the address range 0x08000\_0000 to 0x081D\_FFFF \(1920 KB\) is supported,<br /> which is for L2-LIM and no support is provided for the L2 Zero Device. The fabric<br /> initiators from FIC-0/1/2 can access this L2-LIM. As WAY0 is always reserved for Cache,<br /> simulation model prints a message when the address range 0x081E\_0000 to 0x81F\_FFFF is<br /> accessed from fabric and no read/write happens.
