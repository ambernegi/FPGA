# set\_clock\_latency

## Description

Defines the delay between an external clock source and the definition pin of a clock<br /> within SmartTime.

Clock source latency defines the delay between an external clock source and the<br /> definition pin of a clock within SmartTime. You can specify both an "early" delay<br /> and a "late" delay for this latency, providing an uncertainty which SmartTime<br /> propagates through its calculations. Rising and falling edges of the same clock can<br /> have different latencies. If only one value is provided for the clock source<br /> latency, it is taken as the exact latency value, for both rising and falling<br /> edges.

Clock latency is of two types:

-   External latency \(source\) - From an external source to on-chip clock definition point using the `-source` argument.
-   Internal latency \(network\) - From a clock generator to an end point \(FF\) due to clock tree synthesis \(CTS\).

In FPGA, internal clock latency is not used because the clock tree is already<br /> inserted and Libero SoC tool is already aware of the delay. Hence,<br /> `set_clock_latency` is primarily used to model external latency<br /> in FPGA.

When external clock latency is modeled using the `-source` arguments,<br /> hold calculations are never impacted because the hold checks occur for the same<br /> clock edge. Setup times are only impacted when the `-early` and<br /> `-late` arguments are used because otherwise the clock is<br /> uniformly delayed to all endpoints in the design. The following table summarizes the<br /> behavior:

|`-source` used|`-early` used|`-late` used|Result|
|--------------|-------------|------------|------|
|Yes|No|No|No setup or hold impact|
|Yes|No|Yes|No setup or hold impact|
|Yes|Yes|No|No setup or hold impact|
|Yes|Yes|Yes|Setup check only|
|No|N/A|N/A|Not recommended for FPGA designs.|

Setup time is calculated for a scenario where the launch edge is delayed and<br /> the capture edge is early:

-   The `-early` value is added from the required time.
-   The `-late` value is added to the arrival time

## Arguments

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|`source`|None|Specifies the source latency on a clock pin, potentially only on certain edges of the clock.|
|`rise`|None|Specifies the edge for which this constraint will apply. If neither or both rise and fall are passed, the same latency is applied to both edges.|
|`fall`|None|Specifies the edge for which this constraint will apply. If neither or both fall and rise are passed, the same latency is applied to both edges.|
|`late`|None|Optional. Specifies that the latency is late bound on the latency. The appropriate bound<br /> provide the most pessimistic timing scenario. However, if the value<br /> of `-late` is less than the value of<br /> `-early`, optimistic timing takes place which<br /> could result in incorrect analysis. If neither or both<br /> `-early` and `-late` are provided,<br /> the same latency is used for both bounds, which results in the<br /> latency having no effect for single clock domain setup and hold<br /> checks.|
|`early`|None|Optional. Specifies that the latency is early bound on the latency. The appropriate bound<br /> provide the most pessimistic timing scenario. However, if the value<br /> of `-late` is less than the value of<br /> `-early`, optimistic timing takes place which<br /> could result in incorrect analysis. If neither or both<br /> `-early` and `-late` are provided,<br /> the same latency is used for both bounds, which results in the<br /> latency having no effect for single clock domain setup and hold<br /> checks.|
|`delay`|floating point|Specifies the latency value for the constraint.|
|`clock`|string|Specifies the clock to which the constraint is applied. This clock must be constrained.|

## Error Codes

</table>## Example

The following example sets an early clock source latency of 0.4 on the rising edge of<br /> `main_clock`. It also sets a clock source latency of 1.2, for<br /> both the early and late values of the falling edge of main\_clock. The late value for<br /> the clock source latency for the falling edge of `main_clock` remains<br /> undefined.

```
set_clock_latency –source –rise –early 0.4 { main_clock }
```

```
set_clock_latency –source –fall 1.2 { main_clock }
```
