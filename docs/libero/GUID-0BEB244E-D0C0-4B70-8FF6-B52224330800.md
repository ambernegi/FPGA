|PolarFire®|<br /> Award-winning PolarFire FPGAs deliver the<br /> industry’s lowest power at midrange densities with exceptional<br /> security and reliability. This family of products spans from<br /> 100K Logic Elements \(LEs\) to 500K LEs, features 12.7G<br /> transceivers and offers up to 50% lower power than competing<br /> midrange FPGAs. Get started with your design today by<br /> downloading the Libero SoC PolarFire<br /> Design Suite and ordering a PolarFire FPGA development kit that<br /> best matches your needs.<br /> For more information, see PolarFire.<br />|
|IGLOO® 2|IGLOO® 2 Flash FPGA devices are ideal for<br /> general purpose functions such as Gigabit Ethernet or dual PCI Express® control planes, bridging<br /> functions, input/output \(I/O\) expansion and conversion, video/image<br /> processing, system management and secure connectivity. They are used<br /> in applications for the communications, industrial, medical, defense<br /> and aviation markets.For more information, see IGLOO 2.|
|IGLOO®|<br /> The IGLOO series of ultra-low density FPGAs<br /> includes the IGLOO/e, IGLOO nano and IGLOO PLUS families of<br /> devices. As the industry's lowest-power FPGAs, IGLOO FPGA<br /> families are designed to meet the low-power and small-footprint<br /> requirements of today's portable and power-conscious<br /> electronics.<br /> The low-power IGLOO FPGA series supports up to 35K Logic Elements<br /> \(LEs\) with up to 504 Kb of true dual-port SRAM, up to six<br /> embedded PLLs and up to 620 user I/Os. If your low-power<br /> application requires 32-bit processing, you can use the Arm<br /> Cortex-M1 processor that is available with<br /> IGLOO M1 devices without license fees or royalties.<br /> For more information, see IGLOO.<br />|
|ProASIC® 3|The ProASIC® 3 series of FPGAs, which<br /> includes the ProASIC 3e, ProASIC 3 nano and ProASIC 3L families,<br /> offers a breakthrough in performance, density and features for<br /> today's most demanding high-volume applications. ProASIC 3 FPGAs<br /> support the Arm®<br /> Cortex®-M1 soft processor IP core, offering the<br /> benefits of programmability and time-to-market. The ProASIC 3 FPGA<br /> families are based on nonvolatile Flash technology and support 100<br /> to 35K Logic Elements \(LEs\) and up to 620 I/Os.For more<br /> information, see ProASIC 3.|
|Fusion|Fusion mixed-signal FPGAs integrate configurable analog, large<br /> Flash memory blocks, comprehensive clock generation and management<br /> circuitry and high-performance, Flash-based programmable logic in a<br /> monolithic device. You can use the innovative Fusion FPGA<br /> architecture with our soft microcontroller \(MCU\) core and the<br /> performance-maximized 32-bit [Arm® Cortex®-M1 processor](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/mi-v-ecosystem/5068-arm-cortex-m1-processor). You can also<br /> use Pigeon Point devices \(P1-prefixed devices\) in conjunction with<br /> Pigeon Point ATCA IP cores and firmware. Fusion devices are the<br /> world's first mixed-signal FPGA platform. In addition to supporting<br /> commercial- and industrial-temperature devices, we offer Fusion<br /> FPGAs with specialized screening for extended temperature<br /> applications.For more information, see Fusion.|

|PolarFire® SoC|The PolarFire® SoC FPGA family delivers a<br /> combination of low power consumption, thermal efficiency and<br /> defense-grade security for smart, connected systems. It is the first<br /> System-on-Chip \(SoC\) FPGA with a deterministic, coherent RISC-V CPU<br /> cluster and a deterministic L2 memory subsystem for creating Linux® and real-time applications. PolarFire<br /> SoC FPGAs span from 25K to 460K Logic Elements \(LEs\) and feature<br /> 12.7 Gb/s transceivers.For more information, see PolarFire<br /> SoC.|
|SmartFusion® 2|SmartFusion® 2 Flash FPGA devices are ideal<br /> for general purpose functions such as Gigabit Ethernet or dual PCI<br /> Express® control planes, bridging<br /> functions, input/output \(I/O\) expansion and conversion, video/image<br /> processing, system management and secure connectivity. They are used<br /> a variety of applications in the communications, industrial,<br /> medical, defense and aviation markets.For more information, see<br /> SmartFusion<br /> 2.|
|SmartFusion®|SmartFusion® System-on-Chip \(SoC\) FPGAs are<br /> the only devices that integrate an FPGA fabric, Arm®<br /> Cortex®-M3 processor, and programmable analog<br /> circuitry, Offering the benefits of full customization and IP<br /> protection while still being easy to use. Based on a proprietary<br /> Flash process, SmartFusion SoC FPGAs are excellent for hardware and<br /> embedded designers who need a true SoC solution that gives more<br /> flexibility than traditional fixed-function microcontrollers without<br /> the excessive cost of soft processor cores on traditional<br /> FPGAs.For more information, see SmartFusion.|
