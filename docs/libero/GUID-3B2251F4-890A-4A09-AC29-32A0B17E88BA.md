# SYNTHESIZE

## Description

"SYNTHESIZE" is a command tool used in configure\_tool and run\_tool. Configure\_tool is a general<br /> purpose Tcl command that allows you to configure a tool’s parameters and values<br /> prior to executing the tool. Configure tool then executes the specified tool with<br /> the configured parameters with run\_tool command.

```
configure_tool -name {SYNTHESIZE} [-params {name:value}]
run_tool -name {SYNTHESIZE} 
```

## Arguments

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|CLOCK\_ASYNC|integer|Specifies the threshold value for asynchronous pin promotion to a global net. The default is 12.|
|CLOCK\_GLOBAL|integer|Specifies the threshold value for Clock pin promotion. The default is 2.|
|CLOCK\_DATA|integer|Specifies the threshold value for data pin promotion.The default is 5000. The possible values are integer values between 1000 and 200,000.|
|RAM\_OPTIMIZED\_FOR\_POWER|boolean|Set to true or 1 to optimize RAM for Low Power; RAMS are inferred and configured to ensure the lowest power consumption. Set to false or 0 to optimize RAM for High Speed at the expense of more FPGA resources. The possible values are boolean \{true \| false \| 1 \| 0\}.|
|RETIMING|boolean|Set to true or 1 to enable Retiming during synthesis. Set to false or 0 to disable Retiming during synthesis. The possible values are boolean \{true \| false \| 1 \| 0\}.|
|SYNPLIFY\_OPTIONS|string|Specifies additional synthesis-specific options. Options specified by this parameter override the same options specified in the user Tcl file if there is a conflict.|
|SYNPLIFY\_TCL\_FILE|string|Specifies the absolute or relative path name to the user Tcl file containing synthesis-specific options.|
|BLOCK\_MODE|boolean|Set to true or 1 when you have blocks in your design and you want to enable the Block mode. Set it to false or 0 if you don’t have blocks in your design. Default is false or 0. The possible values are boolean \{true \| false \| 1 \| 0\}.|
|BLOCK\_PLACEMENT\_CONFLICTS|string|Instructs the COMPILE engine what to do when the software encounters a placement conflict. When set to: ERROR - Compile errors out if any instance from a Designer block becomes unplaced. This is the default.KEEP - If some instances get unplaced for any reason, the non-conflicting elements remaining are preserved but not locked. Therefore, the placer can move them into another location if necessary. LOCK- If some instances get unplaced for any reason, the non-conflicting elements remaining are preserved and locked.DISCARD – Discards any placement from the block,even if there are no conflicts. The possible values are \{ERROR \| KEEP \| LOCK \| DISCAR D\}.|
|BLOCK\_ROUTING\_CONFLICTS|string|Instructs the COMPILE engine what to do when the software encounters a routing conflict. When set to: ERROR - Compile errors out if any route in any preserved net from a Designer block is deleted. This is the default. KEEP – If a route is removed from a net for any reason, the routing for the non-conflicting nets is kept unlocked. The router can re-route these nets. LOCK – If routing is removed from a net for any reason, the routing for the non- conflicting nets is kept as locked, and the router will not change them. DISCARD - Discards any routing from the block,even if there are no conflicts. The possible values are \{ERROR \| KEEP \| LOCK \| DISCAR D\}.|
|PA4\_GB\_COUNT|integer|The number of available global nets is reported. Minimum for all dies is “0”. Default and Maximum values are die-dependent: 005/010 die: Default =Max = 8 025/050/060/090/150 die: Default=Max=16 RT4G075/RT4G150: Default=24, Max=48.Note: For RTG4, default is 48.|
|PA4\_GB\_MAX\_RCLKINT\_INSERTION|integer|Specifies the maximum number of global nets that could be demoted to row-globals. Default is 16, Minis 0 and Max is 50.|
|PA4\_GB\_MIN\_GB\_FANOUT\_TO\_USE\_RCLKINT|integer|Specifies the Minimum fanout of global nets that could be demoted to row-globals. Default is 300.Min is 25 and Max is 5000.|
|LANGUAGE\_SYSTEM\_VLOG|boolean|Set to true if the Verilog files contain System Verilog constructs. The possible values are boolean \{true \| false\}.|
|LANGUAGE\_VERILOG\_2001|boolean|Set to true if Verilog files contain Verilog 2001 constructs. The possible values are boolean \{true \| false\}.|
|CDC\_MIN\_NUM\_SYNC\_REGS|integer|Minimum number of synchronizer registers. Range: 2 - 9. Default: 2|
|CDC\_REPORT|boolean|The generated CDC report will not contain any synchronizer circuits formed with macros instantiated from the catalog. The generated report, with the name &lt;root\_name&gt;\_cdc.csv, will be visible in the respective Synthesis node of the report view. The report contains all CDC inferred from the RTL design and explains the reason\(s\) why a synchronizer is considered unsafe.The possible values are boolean \{true \| false\}.|

|Return Type|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|Integer|Both for "configure\_tool -name \{SYNTHESIZE\}" and "run\_tool -name \{SYNTHESIZE\}" returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.|

``` {#CODEBLOCK_D3W_B2X_QSB}
configure_tool -name {SYNTHESIZE} -params {ACTIVE_IMPLEMENTATION:synthesis}
-params {CREATE_IMPLEMENTATION_IDENTIFY:Synthesis_Jan27_N} -params
{SYNPLIFY_OPTIONS:} -params {SYNPLIFY_TCL_FILE:D:/Syn_27.tcl}
```
