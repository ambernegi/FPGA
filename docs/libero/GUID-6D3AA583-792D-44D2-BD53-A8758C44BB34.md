# Memory Partition and Protection

The Physical Memory Protection \(PMP\) prevents a process \(running on a RISC-V Processor\) or an<br /> initiator \(FPGA Fabric\) from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. RISC-V<br /> system has PMP unit, which provides control registers for each processor to allow<br /> physical memory access privileges \(read, write, execute\) to be specified for each<br /> physical memory region. Similarly, the AXI Switch has Memory Protection Unit \(MPU\) block<br /> which provides register control to setup memory access regions for FPGA initiators.

## DDR Memory Partition

The<br /> DDR Memory Partition tab allows the DDR memory to be allocated to cached and<br /> non-cached regions depending on the amount of DDR memory physically<br /> connected.

In the DDR Memory Partition:

-   The Offset Address \(Base Address\) for both cached and non-cached regions is fixed.
-   High Address is the End Address based on the size.
-   Users are expected to enter the Range. Based on the Range selection, High Address and Physical DDR Offset is updated.
    -   When Range is set to zero, memory is not allocated in DDR.
    -   When Range is set to a nonzero value, it must be a multiple of 16 MB.
-   Physical DDR Offset is allocation of DDR memory \(connected to the FPGA system\) based on the nonzero Range value.

    **Important:** When **Setup Physical DDR Address manually** option is enabled, the default Physical DDR Offset Address is set as 0x0000\_0000 for all the regions and it is up to the user to change this address \(when the size of the allocated memory region is greater than 0 bytes\). When the size of allocated memory region is zero bytes, the offset and high address are reported as **N/A** and remains as a read-only field.

-   Range is allocated sequentially starting with 0x0000\_0000 in the following order:

    -   Cached 32-bit
    -   Cached 64-bit
    -   Non-Cached 32-bit
    -   Non-Cached 64-bit
    The following figure shows the graphical representation of how the<br /> Physical DDR Offset allocation is done based on the preceding<br /> ranges:

**Processor Initiators**

Four CPU initiators can be enabled in one of the two Asymmetric Multi Processing \(AMP\) contexts. CPU initiators can access both CPU and Peripherals.

![](GUID-E1C4CC46-CDB5-48F3-A3D6-70CC172C3DF8-low.jpg "Processor Initiators")

**Processor Initiators in Context A and Context B can access the following selected Peripherals**

The AMP Context A is assigned to AHB0 bus interface and AMP<br /> Context B is assigned to AHB1 bus interface. Peripherals can be enabled in<br /> either Context A or in Context B. The range and base address for the peripherals<br /> are populated in Graphical User Interface and are not editable. The base address<br /> will be different for peripherals that are on dual AHB bus interfaces for<br /> Context A and Context B.

**Processor Initiators can access memory regions created below \(DDR/FPGA Fabric memory through FICs\)**

DDR memory appears at several address ranges depending on<br /> whether it is cached, non-cached, or access through a Write Combine Buffer<br /> \(WCB\). WCB improves performance \(by combining multiple writes to the same<br /> address into a single write\) for sequential accesses. Each AMP context needs to<br /> specify how much DDR memory of each type it needs. Some DDR memories may be<br /> shared between AMP Context to pass data. User can create protection for memory<br /> region accessed by processors by clicking on the **Add Memory Region...** button. User can delete any memory region by selecting<br /> the memory region and clicking **Delete** button. The<br /> following figure shows the memory regions available to Processor Initiators.
