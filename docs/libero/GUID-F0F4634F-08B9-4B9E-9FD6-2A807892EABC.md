# Netlist Views

In addition to the chip view for floorplanning purposes, Chip Planner displays a schematic view of the design to make it easier to trace nets and debug the design.

Two netlist types can be displayed in the **Floorplanner View** window:

-   Post-Synthesis Hierarchical View \(**Netlist Viewer - Hier**\)
-   Post-compile flattened Netlist View \(**Netlist Viewer - Flat**\)

The **Floorplanner View** window and **Netlist Viewer - Hier** and **Netlist Viewer - Flat** tabs are<br /> present when Chip Planner is opened.

## Netlist Viewer - Hier

The Post-Synthesis Hierarchical View \(**Netlist Viewer - Hier**\) is a hierarchical view of the netlist after synthesis and after<br /> technology mapping to the Microchip FPGA technology. Click the **Hierarchical View** window to display this view. The Chip Planner loads the netlist into<br /> the system memory and displays it in this window.

When the netlist loads into memory for the first time, a pop-up progress<br /> bar shows the progress of the loading process. Load times may incur a runtime penalty for<br /> large netlists.

## Netlist Viewer - Flat

The **Netlist Viewer - Flat** View is the flattened<br /> \(non-hierarchical\) netlist generated after synthesis, technology mapping, and further<br /> optimization based on the DRC rules of the device family and/or die. Click on the Canvas to<br /> load the 'Flat' view in the **Netlist Viewer - Flat** window to display<br /> this view. The Chip Planner loads the netlist into the system memory and displays it in<br /> this window, as shown in the following figure.

When the netlist loads into memory for the first time, a pop-up progress<br /> bar shows the progress of the loading process. Load times may incur a runtime penalty for<br /> large flattened netlists.

## Display Across Multiple Pages

If a hierarchical or flattened netlist spans across multiple pages, the<br /> first page is displayed when it opens.

The current page number and the total number of pages are shown in the<br /> status bar at the lower right corner of the window.
