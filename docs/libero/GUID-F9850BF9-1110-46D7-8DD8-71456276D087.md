# ODT Dynamic

**Note:** This option is supported for RTG4 production devices only.

This option is used to opt in or out of the dynamic ODT set on a bank. Possible<br /> value are listed in the following table.

|**Value**|**Description**|
|---------|---------------|
|ODT\_STATIC=On ODT\_DYNAMIC=On|Illegal|
|ODT\_STATIC=On ODT\_DYNAMIC=Off|The ODT resistor is always turned on.|
|ODT\_STATIC=Off ODT\_DYNAMIC=Off|The ODT resistor is always turned<br /> off.|
|ODT\_STATIC=Off ODT\_DYNAMIC=On|The ODT resistor is on or off based on<br /> the ODT Dynamic bank setting.|

The following I/O standards are supported:

-   LVDS
-   RSDS
-   MINILVDS
-   LVPECL
-   HSTLI
-   HSTLII
-   SSTL15I
-   SSTL15II
-   SSTL18I
-   SSTL18II
-   HSTL18I
-   HSTL18II
-   LPDDRI
-   LPDDRII

**Note:** There is a known issue in the Libero SoC I/O Editor and the pin report. A software limitation exists where a design cannot have different values for the P and N sides. Currently, both must have the same value. Libero SoC does program the P and N side correctly for programming. In I/O Editor or pin report, if RES\_PULL is Up on both, it means the N side is programmed as Down or vice versa.
