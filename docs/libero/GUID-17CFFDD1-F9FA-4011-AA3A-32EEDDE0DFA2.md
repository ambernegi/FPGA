# Creating Blocks, Options, and Settings

PolarFire Block Flow allows you to publish a reusable component that can be instantiated into another design. A block component includes timing constraints, physical constraints, placement, and routing details. To enable block creation option:

1.  Launch the Libero SoC tool.

2.  For a new project:

    1.  Select **Project** &gt; **New Project**. The **New Project** window appears.

    2.  Specify the project details and select the **Enable block creation** check box.

    3.  Click **Next** and continue with creating a new project.

3.  For an existing project:

    1.  Select **Project** &gt; **Project Settings**. The **Project settings** window appears.

    2.  Click **Design flow** on the left pane.

    3.  Select the **Enable block creation** check box available on the right panel.

    4.  Click **Save** to update the project settings.

        **Important:** To change the block flow settings, you must clean and rerun all your design flow tools. It is recommended that you back up the files you want to preserve.

    5.  Click **Close** to close the Project settings window.

    **Important:** A block flow component may not contain I/O cells and cannot be programmed by itself.
