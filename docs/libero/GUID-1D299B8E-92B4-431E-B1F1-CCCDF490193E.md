# Introduction

In the FPGA design world, constraint files are as<br /> important as design source files. Physical Design Constraints<br /> \(PDC\) are used to constrain the I/O attributes, placement, and<br /> routing during the physical layout phase.

You can enter PDC commands manually using the Libero® SoC Text<br /> Editor. PDC commands can also be generated using Libero SoC’s interactive tools. The I/O<br /> Attribute Editor is the interactive tool for making I/O attribute changes, and the Chip<br /> Planner is the interactive tool for making floorplanning changes.

When changes are made in the I/O Attribute Editor or the Chip Planner,<br /> the PDC file\(s\) are updated to reflect the changes. These PDC<br /> commands can be used as part of a script file to constrain the<br /> Place and Route step of your design.

## Supported Families

This document describes the PDC commands applicable to SmartFusion® 2, IGLOO® 2, and RTG4™ families.
