# DRC Rules

The I/O Editor enforces the following list of common Design Rules Check<br /> \(DRC\) rules:

<br />

-   All I/Os of the same logical lane must be placed within the same physical lane.
-   For any one physical lane, only one logical lane is allowed to be placed.
-   Non-logical lane I/Os can be placed in any physical lane.
-   For RGMII Interface, the \*\_RXC port must be placed on the CLKIN\_S\_\* side of the physical lane.
-   When the CDR is placed in a physical lane, the DQS\_N slot is reserved and is not available for I/O placement.

<br />
