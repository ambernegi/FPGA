# Derived PDC file

This PDC design constraint file creates a region specifically for the CoreConfigP IP Core and places the core in the region created. This constrains the Place and Route engine to place the core in an optimal location resulting in better timing performance of the design when routed. The full hierarchical path from the top is given for the constraint. Modify, if necessary, the hierarchical path to match the names in your design.
