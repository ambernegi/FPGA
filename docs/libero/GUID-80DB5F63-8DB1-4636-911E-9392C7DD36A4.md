# Adding a Component

Right click a component in the Design Tree and select **Load Selection** to add a component to the view. Adding a component to the view is<br /> the same as selecting all lower level macros and adding them to the view. The added macros<br /> are selected.

**Important:** To save runtime for very large components with many low level macros, the macros are added, but cannot be selected.
