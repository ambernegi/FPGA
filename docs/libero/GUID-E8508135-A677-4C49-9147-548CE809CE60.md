# Tcl Command Documentation Conventions

The following table lists the typographical conventions used for the Tcl command<br /> syntax.

|<br /> Syntax Notation<br />|<br /> Description<br />|
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|`command - argument`|Commands and arguments appear in `Courier New`<br /> typeface.|
|`variable`|Variables appear in `Courier New` typeface. You<br /> must substitute an appropriate value for the variable.|
|\[-argument value\] \[variable\]+|Optional arguments begin and end with a square bracket with one<br /> exception: if the square bracket is followed by a plus sign \(+\),<br /> then users must specify at least one argument. The plus sign \(+\)<br /> indicates that items within the square brackets can be repeated. Do<br /> not enter the plus sign character.|
|`#`|Comments can be written using a hash \(`#`\) sign in the<br /> beginning of a text that you want the interpreter to ignore. Comments<br /> can be used to provide helping text in your Tcl program.|

**Important:** All Tcl commands are case sensitive. However, their arguments are not.

## Examples

Syntax for the `get_clocks` command followed by a sample command:

```
get_clocks variable 
```

For example, `get_clocks clk1`.

Syntax for the `backannotate` command followed by a sample<br /> command:

```
backannotate -name file_name -format format_type -language language -dir directory_name [- netlist] [-pin]
```

For example, `backannotate -dir {..\design} -name "fanouttest_ba.sdf" -format "SDF" -language "VERILOG" -netlist`.

## Wildcard Characters

You can use the following wildcard characters in names used in Tcl commands:

|<br /> Wildcard<br />|<br /> What it Does<br />|
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|`\`|Interprets the next character literally.|
|`?`|Matches any single character.|
|`*`|Matches any string.|
|`[]`|Matches any single character among those listed between brackets<br /> \(that is, \[A-Z\] matches any single character in the A-to-Z<br /> range\).|

**Important:** The matching function requires that you add a slash \(\\\) before each slash in the port, instance, or net name when using wildcards in a PDC command. For example, if you have an instance named `A/B12` in the netlist, and you enter that name as `A\\/B*` in a PDC command, you will not be able to find it. In this case, you must specify the name as `A\\\\/B*`.

## Special Characters \[ \], \{ \}, and \\

Sometimes square brackets \(\[ \]\) are part of the command syntax. In these cases, you must<br /> either enclose the open and closed square brackets characters with curly brackets \(\{ \}\) or<br /> precede the open and closed square brackets \(\[ \]\) characters with a backslash \(\\\). If you do<br /> not, you will get an error message.

**Important:** Tcl commands are case sensitive. However, their arguments are not.

## Entering Arguments on Separate Lines

To enter an argument on a separate line, you must enter a backslash \(\\\) character at<br /> the end of the preceding line of the command as shown in the following example:

```
backannotate -dir \
{..\design} -name "fanouttest_ba.sdf" -format "SDF" -language "VERILOG" \
-netlist
```
