# Other Chip Planner Windows

## World View Window

The **World View** shows a red rectangle which reflects<br /> what is visible in the Floorplanner View in the context of the Chip. Changing what is<br /> visible in the canvas also changes the red rectangle. Changing the size or position of the<br /> red rectangle changes what is seen in the Floorplanner View.
