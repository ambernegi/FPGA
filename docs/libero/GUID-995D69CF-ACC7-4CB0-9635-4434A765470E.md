# Overview

[Smart high-level synthesis \(SmartHLS™\) Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/smarthls-compiler) is an Eclipse-based integrated development environment that takes C++ software code as input and generates a SmartDesign IP component \(Verilog HDL\) as an output. Hardware engineers can instantiate the generated SmartDesign IP component in the SmartDesign Canvas available in Libero® SoC design suite to build an FPGA system.

SmartHLS automatically compiles a C/C++ program into hardware<br /> described in Verilog HDL \(Hardware Description Language\). The generated hardware can be<br /> programmed onto a Microchip® FPGA \(Field-Programmable Gate Array\).<br /> Hardware implemented on an FPGA can provide 2-10X performance and power benefits over<br /> the same computation running on regular processors.

SmartHLS includes C/C++ to Verilog high-level synthesis tool and is<br /> tested on Windows and Linux 64-bit operating systems.
