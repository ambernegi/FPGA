# Creating a Logical Cone

Use logical cones to view, highlight, and cross-probe a selected subset of the netlist. Logical cones can be created from all three views: RTL, Hierarchical Post-Synthesis, and Flat Post-Compile.

To create a logical cone:

1.  Click to select the netlist view \(RTL/Hierarchical/Flat\) from which to create a logical cone.
2.  Click the Create Cone icon on the toolbar and add design objects to the cone, or select a design object such as a net or an instance.
3.  Right click and select **Add to Target Cone**, **Driver/Load**, **All Connected Logic**.
