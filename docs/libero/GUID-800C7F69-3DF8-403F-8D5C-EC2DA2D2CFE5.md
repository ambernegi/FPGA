# Introduction

This user guide describes the Microchip Secure Production Programming<br /> Solution \(SPPS\), and includes the following information:

-   High-level SPPS overview
-   Use models
-   Software/hardware components of SPPS
-   Tools flow

SPPS is a solution provided by Microchip for secure programming of SmartFusion® 2, IGLOO® 2, PolarFire®, and<br /> PolarFire SoC devices in untrusted environments.

The Operation Engineer \(OE\) uses SPPS to prepare secure programming jobs based on design<br /> information received from design and firmware engineers. The created secure programing<br /> job is executed by manufacturing as part of the SPPS on the site of the Contract<br /> Manufacturer \(CM\).

SPPS provides the following during manufacturing in an untrusted environment or where<br /> insiders might be present:

-   Ensures confidentiality of user design and security keys used through a secure initial key loading mechanism.
-   Prevents unauthorized programming of the user design through an overbuild protection mechanism, preventing overbuilding of electronic systems.
