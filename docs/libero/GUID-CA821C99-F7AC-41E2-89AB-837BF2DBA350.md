# HSM Server Installation and Provisioning

U-HSM and M-HSM server installation and provisioning can be done manually or by using the setup<br /> utility provided by Microchip.

For information about obtaining components of the HSM servers and installation and provisioning<br /> instructions, see the [User HSM Installation and Setup User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/user_hsm_ug.pdf) for the U-HSM and the [Manufacturer HSM Installation and Setup User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/man_hsm_ug.pdf) for the M-HSM.

## Use of the Microchip Web Portal

The [Microchip Website](https://www.microchip.com/) is designed to provide SPPS customers with a convenient way to interact with<br /> Microchip Manufacturing HSM during the provisioning of the U-HSM and the M-HSM. It also<br /> allows Microchip IHP customers to initiate and control their programming jobs executed<br /> by IHP.
