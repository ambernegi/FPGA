# Programming Production

The following figure shows the Microchip programming production flow. The flow supports simple<br /> programming jobs and bit stream file exports directly from the Libero tool, represented with<br /> the blue components in the following figure. Libero-based production flow only supports<br /> non-secured programming, based on KLK key mode. For more information, see the [Libero SoC Design Flow User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/libero_ecf_ug.pdf).

The Job Manager extends that capability: allowing bit stream file and programming job generation<br /> outside of the Libero tool, and the support of SPPS flow, represented with green components in<br /> the following figure.

Bitstream files \(STAPL, DAT, and SPI\) are programmed using FlashPro,<br /> DirectC, or Silicon Sculptor. STAPL file can be used by third party JTAG production<br /> programming tools to program Microchip devices. Programming jobs are supported by FlashPro<br /> Express only. The following figure shows the debug flow. It allows DDC generation outside of<br /> the Libero tool supports SPPS flow, represented with green components.

The main SPPS flow is based on the use of HSM in the Operation and<br /> Production site. It supports the advanced production the programming models and SmartDebug as<br /> described in the following sections.
