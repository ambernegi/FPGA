# Downloading and Installing IP MegaVault without an Internet Connection

The MegaVault application includes a list of Microchip IP cores. When you install the application, you can add the IP cores to an existing vault or create a new vault on the local machine or server. Perform the following steps if the machine on which Libero is installed lacks Internet access or has security restrictions that prevent IP cores from being downloaded from the Libero Catalog:

1.  Download and install the following MegaVault installer for the required Libero SoC versions.

    -   [MegaVault v12.0 and later](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-later-versions#Documents%20and%20Downloads)
    -   [MegaVault v11.9 and earlier](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-early-versions#Documents%20and%20Downloads)
2.  Install the MegaVault application and change the Vault location as required.

3.  Download individual IP cores \(`.zip` files\) into the Vault. To obtain specific cores and versions, download the `.cpz` file and import it into the Libero Vault. For a complete list of cores, see the following core indexes:

    -   [DirectCores](http://www.microchip-ip.com/cwps/download_index/DirectCore)
    -   [SgCores](http://www.microchip-ip.com/cwps/download_index/SgCore)
    -   [Firmware cores](http://www.microchip-ip.com/cwps/download_index/Firmware)
4.  To import the downloaded cores into Libero SoC, perform the following steps:

    1.  Launch the Libero SoC software.

    2.  To open the **Catalog** window, on the **Windows** menu, go to **View** &gt; **Catalog**.

    3.  Select **Option**, and then select **Add Core to Vault**.

    4.  Browse to the downloaded `.cpz` file, and then import it to the Vault location specified in your Libero software. The imported cores are added to the specified Vault location.
