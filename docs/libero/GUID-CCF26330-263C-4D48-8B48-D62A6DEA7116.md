3.  Click **Edit with Constraints Editor &gt; Edit Place and Route Constraints**.

    ![???](GUID-0624B5F4-965A-44C2-B9BA-B02E220F7BD5-low.jpg "Constraints Editor—Add Clock Constraint")

    The Constraints Editor appears.

4.  In the Constraints Editor, right-click **Clock** under **Requirement** and select **Add Clock Constraint**.

    The Create Clock Constraint dialog box appears.

    ![???](GUID-C23898BD-F2ED-42DA-9984-8E4A63E72929-low.jpg "Create Clock Constraint Dialog Box")

5.  From the **Clock Source** drop-down menu, choose the **CLK** pin.

6.  In the **Clock Name** field, type `my_clk`.

7.  Set the **Frequency** to 250 MHz \(as shown in the following figure\) and accept all other default values.

    ![???](GUID-A2B094F6-4FCB-4C73-850D-82CE11B65746-low.jpg "Add a 250 MHz Clock Constraint")

8.  Click **OK** to continue.

    The clock constraint appears in the SmartTime Constraints Editor.

    ![???](GUID-9BC19F69-41F4-4696-B1BC-C180846219C9-low.jpg "250 MHz Clock Constraint in the Constraint Editor")

9.  From the **File** menu, choose **Save** to save the constraints.

10. From the SmartTime **File** menu, choose **Exit** to exit SmartTime.

    Libero creates a constraint file to store the clock constraint. This file appears in the Constraint Manager. It is named **user.sdc** and designated as **Target**.

    **Note:** A target file is used to store newly added constraints from the Constraint Editor. If you invoke the Constraint Editor with no SDC timing constraint file present, Libero SoC creates the user.sdc file and marks it as **Target** to store the timing constraints you create in the Constraint Editor.

11. In the Constraint Manager, check the check boxes under **Place and Route** and **Timing Verification** to associate the constraint file to the tools. The constraint file is used for both Place and Route and Timing verification.

    ![???](GUID-00507744-E29C-439D-9F67-8755311B7AE6-low.jpg "SDC Constraint File and Tool Association")

After routing the design, you analyze the timing, set<br /> false path constraints, and observe the maximum operating frequency in the SmartTime<br /> Timing Analysis window.

<br />

![???](GUID-9B362C17-BB7E-4FD8-AE8F-E24FD0C15397-low.jpg "Example Design with False Paths")

<br />

### Set Up Your False Path Example Design Project

To set up your false path example design project:

1.  Open Libero.

2.  From the **Project** menu, choose **New Project** to create a new project.

3.  Name the project `false_path` and set the project location according to your preferences.

4.  Click **Next**.

    -   **Die Voltage**: 1.2 V
    -   **Range**: COM
6.  Click **Finish** to create the new project.


### Import the false\_path Verilog File and Add Constraints

For this tutorial, you import the [false\_path.v](GUID-CCF26330-263C-4D48-8B48-D62A6DEA7116.md#) Verilog source file into your design, and then run Libero SoC.

To import the Verilog source file:

1.  From the **File** menu, choose **Import &gt; HDL Source Files**.

2.  Browse to the location of the false\_path.v you saved and select it. Click **Open** to import the file.

3.  Verify that the file appears in Design Hierarchy.

4.  In the Design Flow window, double-click **Synthesize** to run synthesis.

    A green check mark appears when the Synthesis step completes successfully.

5.  Expand **Edit Constraints**.

6.  Right-click **Timing Constraints** and choose **Open Interactively**.

7.  Double-click **Manage Constraints**.

8.  Select the **Timing** tab.

9.  Expand the **Edit with Constraint Editor** sub-menu, and select **Edit Place and Route Constraints**.

    The Constraints Editor appears.

10. Double-click **Requirements: Clock**.

    The Create Clock Constraint dialog box appears.

11. Double click the **Browse** button for **Clock Source**, select **CLK**, and assign it a name \(for example, `clk`\).

12. Set the frequency to 100 MHz.

    ![???](GUID-44C04215-7238-40D7-A34A-7F4A766E3957-low.jpg "Clock Constraint of 100 MHz")

13. Click **OK** to return to the Constraints Editor and observe that the clock information has been filled in, as shown in the following figure.

    ![???](GUID-CC5E20F1-FFAA-4E5D-8D45-63EEA18A7570-low.png "Clock Constraint of 100 MHz in false_path Design")

14. Save your changes \(**File &gt; Save**\) and close the Constraints Editor \(**File &gt; Close**\).

15. In the Constraint Manager, check the check boxes under **Place and Route** and **Timing Verification** to associate the constraint file to both tools. The constraint file is used for both Place and Route and Timing verification.


### Place and Route Your FALSE\_PATH Design

To run Place and Route on false\_path design:

1.  In Libero SoC, right-click **Place and Route**and choose **Configure Options**.

    The Layout Options dialog box appears.

    ![???](GUID-524F5536-7CCB-4E9B-8812-58A3742F002F-low.jpg "Layout Options Dialog Box")

2.  Click the check box to enable **Timing-Driven** layout and leave all other values unchecked.

3.  Click **OK** to close the Layout Options dialog box.

4.  Right-click **Place and Route** and choose **Run**.

    A green check mark appears next to **Place and Route** in the Design Flow window when Place and Route completes successfully.

    ![???](GUID-4169D031-8999-47C9-A6EA-D07B34B570C2-low.jpg "Synthesize and Place and Route Successful Completion")


### Timing Analysis—Maximum Clock Frequency

The SmartTime Maximum Delay Analysis View displays the design maximum operating frequency and lists any setup violations.

To perform maximum delay analysis:

1.  Expand **Verify Post Layout Implementation**.

2.  Right-click **Open SmartTime** and choose **Open Interactively** to open SmartTime.

    The Maximum Delay Analysis View appears. The Maximum Delay Analysis View summarizes design performance and indicates that the design will operate at a maximum frequency of 442.48 MHz.

    **Note:** You may see a slightly different maximum frequency with a different version of Libero SoC.

    ![???](GUID-9FE9A4AF-0FAB-4CED-847F-F960456563D3-low.jpg)

3.  Expand **clk** to expand the display and show the Register to Register path sets.

4.  Select **Register to Register** to display the register-to-register paths. Notice that the slack values are positive.

    ![???](GUID-494EC740-A134-461D-9D4F-BBF0809ECE80-low.jpg "Expanded Path")

5.  Double-click to select and expand the row in the path list with the path is from the CLK pin of flip-flop D0\_reg to the D input of flip flop Q\_reg. Note that the path goes through the S input of multiplexer un1\_MUX2.

    Looking at the code in false\_path.v, you can see on lines 51 and 52, that D0\_reg and D\)\_inv\_reg are always the inverse of each other in "operational" mode \(except when RST is active\). Line 56 says that XOR2 is the XOR of these two signals, and hence always 1 \(except when RST is active\). Line 59 says that XOR2 is the select of MUX2.

    We might reasonably decide that we are not interested in the reset mode delay for this design; therefore, this path is a false path for our timing analysis purposes.

    ![???](GUID-9D789DE0-0BF9-4409-9C8A-81EBE00F1DC5-low.png "Analyzing the False Paths")

    Similar analysis shows that the path from D0\_inv\_reg:CLK to Q\_reg:D shares exactly the same false-path characteristic. Disable both paths.

6.  Restart the Libero Constraints Editor. The Constraints Editor must be running to use SmartTime’s back-annotation feature. Go to the **Constraint Manager** tab, then go to the **Timing** sub-tab, pull down **Edit with Constraint Editor**, and choose **Edit Timing Verification Constraints**.

7.  Leave this running and return to SmartTime.

8.  From the **Tools** menu, select **Max Delay Analysis**.

9.  To set the path from D0\_inv\_reg:CLK to Q\_reg :D as false, select the row containing this path in the Register to Register path set, right-click and choose **Add False Path Constraint**.

    The Set False Path Constraint dialog box appears. It might pop behind the current dialog box, so check other Constraint Manager windows.

    ![???](GUID-557201F7-4128-4A7A-944C-3C9FD194CFA2-low.jpg "Right-Clicking Add False Path Constraint")

10. Click **OK** to close the Set False Path Constraint dialog box.

11. In the Constraints Editor window, check for an entry below **Exceptions &gt; False Path**.

12. Return to the SmartTime window and repeat for the D0\_reg:CLK -&gt; Q\_reg:D path.

13. Because we are interested only in timing analysis through the MUX when select = 1, we can ignore the MUX "0" path from D1\_reg:D through the AND2. We make this a false path. At this point the Constraints Editor should now look as follows. Save the file and exit the Constraints Editor and SmartTime.

14. ![???](GUID-05989FD3-241A-4209-BE96-38F6F1E78A87-low.jpg "False Path Constraints in the SmartTime Constraint Editor")

    Place and Route is now invalidated and must be re-run before we can perform timing analysis<br /> again. This is because we changed the constraint file we are using for both<br /> Place and Route and for Timing Analysis. We can use different constraint files,<br /> in which case we would not need to re-run Place and Route.

15. Right-click **Open SmartTime** and choose **Update and Open Interactively**.

    You will see that Place and Route is run automatically before SmartTime is restarted.

16. View the summary in the Maximum Delay Analysis View \(**Tools &gt; Max Delay Analysis**\). SmartTime now reports the maximum operating frequency as 586.17 MHz, as shown in the following figure.

    **Note:** The maximum operating frequency may vary slightly with a different version of the Libero software.

    ![???](GUID-81D57110-1345-42E0-ACF7-153FB0D12266-low.jpg "Maximum Delay Analysis View—Summary")

17. Select the Register to Register set for my\_clk. Observe that only one path is visible, from D2\_reg: CLK to Q\_reg:D. This is the only path that propagates a signal, as shown in the following figure.

18. ![???](GUID-D4AB48F6-F712-41F4-A7CA-892D4FC13BA2-low.jpg "Maximum Delay Analysis View—Register to Register")

19. Close SmartTime.

20. Close Libero SoC.
