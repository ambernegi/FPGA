# Canvas Window

The Canvas Window displays the:

-   RTL view
-   Hierarchical Post-Synthesis view
-   Flat Post-Compile view
-   Flat Post-Compile Cone view
-   Cones view
-   Opened HDL files \(not available in the Flat Post-Compile view\)
-   Start Pageâ€”when no netlist views are opened

When a view is opened, a view tab is added across the top of the Canvas<br /> window for ease of switching between views.

**Important:** To get a larger display area for the Canvas view, hide the Design Tree Window \(**Netlist Viewer** &gt; **Windows** &gt; **Uncheck Show Tree**\) and hide the **Log** window \(**Netlist Viewer** &gt; **Windows** &gt; **Uncheck** &gt; **Show Log**\) Hiding the **Log** window and the **Design Tree** window leaves more display area for the **Canvas** window. Alternatively, press **CTRL+W** to maximize the work area.
