# Validating the SmartDesign Using the DRC

After instantiating all the components and connecting them together, the SmartDesign component must be validated and generated.

Click **Design Rule Check** in the SmartDesign toolbar to generate the<br /> SmartDesign component HDL file. This component can be used by downstream processes such as<br /> synthesis and simulation. You can also instantiate the SmartDesign component into another<br /> SmartDesign. When you generate your SmartDesign, the tool invokes the Design Rules Checker<br /> \(DRC\) to verify the connectivity of your design. Undriven input pins \(output ports\), floating<br /> output pins \(input ports\), and any other DRC violations are reported.

These errors are printed in the **Log**or **Message**window. Any errors must be addressed before a component can be generated<br /> successfully.

**Tip:** You can choose a generated HDL file language from the **Project** &gt; **Project Settings** &gt; **Design flow** tab.

The following table list the DRC errors and the corresponding solutions to fix the<br /> errors.

|DRC Error|Solution|
|---------|--------|
|Unused Instance|You must remove this instance or connect at least one output pin<br /> to the rest of the design.|
|Out-of-date Instance|You must update the instance to reflect a change in the component<br /> interface – ports and/or parameters, referenced by this instance.|
|Undriven Pin|You must connect the pin to a driver or tie it to "1" \(tie high\),<br /> "0" \(tie low\) or, a constant \(tie to constant for bus\\slice pins\).|
|Floating Driver|You can mark the pin unused if it is not going to be used in the<br /> current design. Pins marked unused are ignored by the Design Rules Check.|
|Unconnected Bus Interface|You must connect this Bus Interface to a compatible port because<br /> it is a required connection.|
|Required Bus Interface Connection|You must connect this Bus Interface before you generate the<br /> design. These are typically silicon connection rules.|
|Exceeded Allowable Instances for Core|Some IP cores can only be instantiated a certain<br /> number of times in a design. For example, there can only be one Arm® Cortex®-M1 or<br /> CoreMP7 in a design due to silicon constraints. You must remove the extra instances.<br /> This check is technology-dependent.|
|Incompatible Family Configuration|The instance is not configured to work with this project's Family<br /> setting. Either it is not supported by this family, or you need to re-instantiate the<br /> core. This DRC check is family/ technology-dependent.|
|No RTL License, No Obfuscated License, No Evaluation<br /> License|You do not have the proper license to generate this core. Contact<br /> Microchip SoC to obtain the necessary license.|
|No Top level ports|There are no ports in this design. Use the **Create Port** menu or toolbar command to create ports and connect these ports to<br /> the intended pins in the design.|
|Self-Instantiation|A component cannot instantiate itself.This message is reported<br /> only in the Log window.|
|Bus interface data width mismatch|There is a data width mismatch between the<br /> `<instance1>:<port1>[left1:right1]` and<br /> `<instance1>:<port1>[left2:right2]`, ports implicitly<br /> connected through a Bus Interface net, which might result in loss of data.To<br /> correct an error, make the initiator \(driver\) BIF pin write port width less than or<br /> equal to the target BIF pin write port width as per the port name shown in the DRC<br /> message.Another way to correct the error is to make the target BIF pin read<br /> port width less than or equal to the initiator \(driver\) BIF pin read port width as<br /> per the port name shown in the DRC message.Preceding types of corrections<br /> require to reconfigure the Initiator or the Target core component.|
|Bus interface ID width mismatch|There is an ID width mismatch between the<br /> `<instance1>:<port1>[left1:right1]` and<br /> `<instance1>:<port1>[left2:right2]`, ports implicitly<br /> connected through a Bus Interface net, which might result in loss of data.To<br /> correct an error, make the initiator \(driver\) BIF Pin AWID, WID, or ARID port width<br /> less than or equal to the target BIF pin AWID, WID, or ARID port width as per the<br /> port name shown in the DRC message.Another way to correct an error is to make<br /> the target BIF pin RID or BID port width less than or equal to the initiator<br /> \(driver\) BIF pin RID/BID port width as per port name shown in the DRC<br /> message.Preceding types of corrections require to reconfigure the initiator<br /> or target core component.|
