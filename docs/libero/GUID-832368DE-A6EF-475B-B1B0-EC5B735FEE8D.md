# Slew

The slew rate is the amount of rise or fall time an input signal takes to<br /> get from logic low to logic high or vice versa. It is commonly defined to be the<br /> propagation delay between 10% and 90% of the signal's voltage swing. The I/O Editor<br /> supports slew rate control in non-differential output mode. Turning the slew rate on<br /> results in faster slew rate, which improves the available timing margin. When slew rate is<br /> turned off, the device uses the maximum slew rate for the I/O standard to reduce the impact<br /> of simultaneous switching noise \(SSN\). By default, the slew control is OFF. Not all I/O<br /> standards support the slew rate control.
