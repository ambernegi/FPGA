# Importing a Block

To import a block:

1.  From the **File**menu, choose **Import &gt; Blocks**.
2.  Browse to the directory that contains the `<design_block_name>.cxz` file, and then select the file.
3.  Click **Open**.

The `<design_block_name>` file is imported into the `top_level` project. Version control is not supported for imported blocks. If you import the same block twice, the new block overwrites the existing block.

Files are imported under the `<design>\component\work\<design_block_name>` folder. See the Block reports in the directory.
