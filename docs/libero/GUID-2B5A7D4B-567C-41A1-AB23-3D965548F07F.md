# Security Overwrite

Security overwrite ignores security settings imported into the Programming Data entry<br /> from Libero \(via the JDC file\) and uses settings imported from the SPM file on disk.<br /> After import, the external SPM file is no longer used by the Job Manager.

Security overwrite is available in HSM flow and non-HSM flow. In both flows, security<br /> policy is used from the overwrite, while key values follow these rules:

**HSM Flow:**

-   Key values are always used from the keyset file.

**Non-HSM Flow:**

-   Key values are used from the security settings of the security overwrite.
-   For keys that were overwritten using the `set_key` command \(see [Key Overwrite \(Non-HSM Flow\)](GUID-B2F59F83-912F-4ABB-8F5F-1A5D51968ADD.md)\), the key overwrite value is used.

For details, see the `set_security_overwrite` and<br /> `remove_security_overwrite` Tcl commands in [Tcl Interface](GUID-FD8753E1-1846-4C6B-83DC-B3A5FBD3ACFB.md#).
