# Export SPI Directory

The Job Manager can be used to create the SPI directory used by SmartFusion®<br /> 2/IGLOO® 2 devices during auto-update and programming recovery. The SPI<br /> directory contains information about golden and update programming bitstreams placed by<br /> the user into SPI Flash.

The SPI directory is created with the `export_spi_directory` Tcl command. It does<br /> not require an existing Job Manager project.

The version number for the golden and update bitstreams can be entered manually or by providing<br /> previously generated SPI files. The user also needs to provide addresses for both images<br /> in the final Flash memory.

For more information about using the SPI Flash directory, refer to the [Libero SoC Design Flow User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/libero_ecf_ug.pdf).
