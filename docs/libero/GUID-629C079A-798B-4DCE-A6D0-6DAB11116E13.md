# Component Life Cycle

The following steps describe the life cycle of an SoC component and provide instructions<br /> on how to handle the data.

1.  Generate the component using its configurator in Libero SoC. This generates the following types of data:
    -   HDL files
    -   Memory files
    -   Stimulus and Simulation files
    -   Component SDC file
2.  For HDL files, instantiate and integrate them in the rest of the HDL design using the external design entry tool/process.
3.  Supply memory files and stimulus files to your simulation tool.
4.  Supply Component SDC file to Derive Constraint tool for Constraint Generation. See [Appendix Câ€”Derive Constraints](GUID-05E323D6-53B9-484F-8989-7AB23AB58F56.md) for more details.
5.  You must create a second Libero project, where you import the post-Synthesis netlist and your component metadata, thus completing the connection between what you generated and what you program.
