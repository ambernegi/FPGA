# Appendix-Accessing IP Core Documentation

The IP cores are integrated with the LiberoÂ® SoC Design Suite. The use of IP<br /> cores not only shortens the design cycle time but also provides proven and reliable<br /> design components for re-use in multiple applications. The IP Catalog in Libero provides<br /> an interface to access and manage the entire set of IP cores and their documentation.

To access the IP Core documentation, follow the steps:

1.  In Libero SoC, click the **Catalog** tab and select an IP core. The documentation associated with the IP core are listed under the **Documentation** view on the **Catalog** tab.
2.  Alternatively, right click on any IP core in the IP **Catalog**.
3.  Select **Open Documentation** from the context menu that appears. A list of the various documents available for the selected core appears.
4.  Click on the required document to open it.
