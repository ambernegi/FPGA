# Peripheral and Embedded Hard Blocks

Various features of the architecture are located within the periphery but are not available<br /> within the FPGA array. These features can be incorporated within a block design but must<br /> be carefully enclosed to all the feature's I/Os within the block. Following are the list<br /> of features for PolarFire design:

-   DRI
-   APBM
-   SCB
-   ENFORCE
-   DEBUG
-   TVS
-   OSC\_RC200MHZ
-   PF\_SPI
-   SC\_STATUS
-   UJTAG\_SEC
-   SYS\_SERVICES
-   VOLTAGEDETECT
-   OSC\_RC2MHZ
-   INIT
-   TAMPER
-   PCIE
-   XCVR\_PIPE\_AXI0
-   XCVR\_PIPE\_AXI1

**Note:** While checking these interfaces in Chip Planner, flyline connections could converge at a single co-ordination. A large bus structure spread across an area is seen in the Chip Planner when the actual routing is viewed. If any I/O has an external name, off the chip, then it must be the same port name as in the top-level of the design.
