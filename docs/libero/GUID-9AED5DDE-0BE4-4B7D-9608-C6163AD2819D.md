# Use of Hardware Security Modules

An HSM is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages user key information. It allows execution of algorithms making use of those keys inside the security boundaries provided by the module. HSM modules protect the information they process. They consist of specially sealed packaging and various tamper-resistant and tamper-evident protection mechanisms.

The HSM module is attached to the PC \(HSM Server\) through hardware interfaces such as USB or<br /> PCIe. Storage space in the module is limited and most of the data used by the HSM is<br /> stored on the PC side in encrypted form. Inâ€‘module memory contains an encryption key for<br /> protecting external data and data that must be physically uncloneable, such as overbuild<br /> protection counters.

SPPS uses two types of HSM: User HSM \(U-HSM\) and Manufacturer HSM \(M-HSM\).
