# Creation of SPI Directory

SPPS provides a way to create an SPI directory similar to that of the Libero tool. For more<br /> information, see the [Libero SoC Design Flow User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/libero_ecf_ug.pdf).

The SPI directory allows the user to set up addresses for device self-programming images \(golden and update\).

This operation does not require HSM support and is not bound to a particular Job Manager project.<br /> See [Job Manager User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/spps_job_mgr_ug.pdf) for details.
