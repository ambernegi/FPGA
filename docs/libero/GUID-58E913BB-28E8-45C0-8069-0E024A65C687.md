# I/O Standard

This field specifies the I/O standard the device supports. Different I/O types have different I/O standards. The pull-down list displays the valid I/O standards for that particular type of I/Os. The list of valid I/O standards is limited to what the I/O bank \(to which the I/O belongs\) can support.
