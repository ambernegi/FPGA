# On-Die Termination

On-Die Termination \(ODT\) is an option used to terminate input signals in PolarFire devices. Terminating input signals helps to maintain signal quality, save board space, and reduces external component costs. In PolarFire FPGAs, ODT is available in receive mode and also in bidirectional mode when the I/O acts as an input. If ODT is not used or not available, the I/O standards may require external termination for better signal integrity.

ODT can be a pull-up, pull-down, differential, or Th√©venin termination with both static and dynamic control available, and is set using either the Libero SoC software I/O attribute editor or by using a PDC command.

In addition, ODT can be controlled dynamically for individual I/Os as well as for all I/Os in a lane simultaneously on a per-lane basis.
