# ODT Static

On-die termination \(ODT\) is the technology where the termination resistor<br /> for impedance matching in transmission lines is located inside a semiconductor chip instead<br /> of on a printed circuit board. Possible values are listed in the following table.

|**Value**|**Description**|
|---------|---------------|
|on|Yes, the termination resistor for impedance matching is located inside the chip.|
|off|No, the termination resistor is on the printed circuit board.|
