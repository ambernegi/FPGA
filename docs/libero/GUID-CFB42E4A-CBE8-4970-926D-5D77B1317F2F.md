# On-Die Termination

On-Die Termination \(ODT\) is an option used to terminate input signals in<br /> PolarFire devices. Terminating input signals helps to maintain signal quality, save board<br /> space, and reduces external component costs. In SmartFusion 2, IGLOO 2, RTG4, and PolarFire<br /> FPGAs, ODT is available in receive mode and also in bidirectional mode when the I/O acts as an<br /> input. If ODT is not used or not available, the I/O standards may require external termination<br /> for better signal integrity.

ODT can be a pull-up, pull-down, differential, or Thévenin termination<br /> with both static and dynamic control available, and is set using either the Libero® SoC<br /> software I/O attribute editor or by using a PDC command.

In addition, ODT can be controlled dynamically for individual I/Os as well as for all I/Os in a lane simultaneously on a per-lane basis.
