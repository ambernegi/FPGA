# Region Assignments

When you right click an item in one of the tabs in the Main Object<br /> Browser, you can choose from available options, which can include placing an item to a<br /> location, unplacing an item from a location, locking the placement, and assigning a<br /> region.

Multiple items can be selected and assigned to the same region at the same<br /> time. You can also select a region assignment by right clicking an item and choosing **Region Assign**. The dialog box opens as shown in the following<br /> figure. This option is not available for objects in the Region tab.
