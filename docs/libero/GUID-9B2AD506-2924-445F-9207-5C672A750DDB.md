# HSM Hardware Modules used by SPPS

SPPS uses nShield Edge \([Figure   1](GUID-9B2AD506-2924-445F-9207-5C672A750DDB.md#FIG_UL5_1MR_SNB)\) and nShield Solo \([Figure   2](GUID-9B2AD506-2924-445F-9207-5C672A750DDB.md#FIG_XF2_CMR_SNB)\)<br /> hardware security modules \(HSMs\) manufactured by Thales. Both modules carry a FIPS140-2<br /> Level 3 security certificate.

nShield Edge is a USB-attached module.

nShield Edge HSMs have an integrated smart card reader. The included card reader for<br /> nShield Solo HSMs is external.

In performance, nShield Solo surpasses nShield Edge. nShield Solo is optimal for use in<br /> U‑HSM for performance-intensive programming Authentication Code and one-time passcode<br /> generation. nShield Edge is optimal for use in M‑HSM for handling lightweight bit stream<br /> generation operations. From the software and setup perspective, both the modules are<br /> interchangeable, and module type selection is typically based on specific use conditions<br /> and the size of the SmartFustion2/IGLOO2 devices they serve.

The HSM module has standard Thales-provided cryptographic algorithms and can execute<br /> custom algorithms within the security boundaries provided by the HSM module.

The HSM module has limited internal nonvolatile memory size for storing the module<br /> initiater key and Job Ticket information such as Ticket binding data, overbuild<br /> protection data, so on. All other information that requires protection by HSM is stored<br /> on the hard disk of the host PC.
