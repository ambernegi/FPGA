## RAM1K18\_RT

The RAM1K18\_RT block contains 24,576 \(18,432 with ECC\) memory bits and is a true<br /> dual-port memory with two independent data ports A and B. The RAM1K18\_RT memory can also be<br /> configured in two-port mode. All read/write operations to the RAM1K18\_RT memory are<br /> synchronous. To improve the read-data delay, an optional pipeline register at the output is<br /> available. RAM1K18\_RT also adds a Read-enable control to both dual-port and two-port modes.<br /> The RAM1K18\_RT memory has two data ports which can be independently configured in any<br /> combination as follows.

-   ECC Dual-Port RAM with the following configuration:
    -   1Kx18 on both ports
-   Non-ECC Dual-Port RAM with the following configurations:
    -   1Kx18 on both ports
    -   2Kx12 or 2Kx9 on both ports, but port B is read-only
    -   2Kx9 on port A, 1Kx18 on port B
-   ECC Two-Port RAM with the following configurations:
    -   Any of 512x36 or 1Kx18 on each port
-   Non-ECC Two-Port RAM with port A write, port B read:
    -   Any of 1Kx18 or 2Kx9 on each port
    -   2Kx12 on both ports
-   Non-ECC Two-Port RAM with port A read, port B write:
    -   Any of 512x36, 1Kx18, or 2Kx9 on each port

        FUNCTIONALITY


The main features of the RAM1K18\_RT memory block are as follows:

-   The address, data, block-port select, write enable and read-enable inputs are registered.
-   An optional pipeline register with a separate enable and synchronous-reset is available at the read-data port to improve the clock-to-out delay.
-   The registers in RAM1K18\_RT block have an option to mitigate Single-event transients.
-   There is an independent clock for each port. The memory will be triggered at the rising edge of the clock.
-   Read from both ports at the same location is allowed.
-   Read and write on the same location at the same time results in unknown data to be read. There is no collision prevention or detection. However, correct data are expected to be written into the memory.
-   When ECC is enabled, each port of the RAM1K18\_RT memory can raise flags to indicate single-bit-correct and double-bit-detect.

The following figure shows a simplified block diagram of the RAM1K18\_RT memory block and the following table gives the port descriptions. The simplified block illustrates the two independent data ports and the read-data pipeline registers.

## RAM64x18\_RT

The RAM64x18\_RT block contains 1,536 \(1,152 with ECC\) memory bits and is a<br /> three-port memory providing one write port and two read ports. Write operations to the<br /> RAM64x18\_RT memory are synchronous. Read operations can be asynchronous or synchronous for<br /> setting up the address and reading out the data. Enabling synchronous operation at the<br /> read-address port improves setup timing for the read-address and its enable signals. Enabling<br /> synchronous operation at the read-data port improves clock-to-out delay. Each data port on the<br /> RAM64x18\_RT memory can be independently configured in any combination as follows.

-   ECC Three-Port RAM with the following configuration:
    -   64x18 on all three ports
-   Non-ECC Three-Port RAM with the following configurations:
    -   Any of 64x18 or 128x9 on each port
    -   128x12 on all three ports

        FUNCTIONALITY


The main features of the RAM64x18\_RT memory block are as follows.

-   There are two independent read-data ports A and B, and one write-data port C.
-   The write operation is always synchronous. The write-address, write-data, C block-port select and write enable inputs are registered.
-   For both read-data ports, setting up the address can be synchronous or asynchronous.
-   The two read-data ports have address registers with a separate enable and synchronous-reset for synchronous mode operation, which can also be bypassed for asynchronous mode operation.
-   The two read-data ports have output registers with a separate enable and synchronous-reset for pipeline mode operation, which can also be bypassed for asynchronous mode operation.
-   Therefore, there are four read operation modes for ports A and B:
    -   Synchronous read-address without read-data pipeline registers \(sync-async\)
    -   Synchronous read-address with read-data pipeline registers \(sync-sync\)
    -   Asynchronous read-address without read-data pipeline registers \(async-async\)
    -   Asynchronous read-address with read-data pipeline registers \(async-sync\)
-   In ECC mode, all ports have word widths equal to 18 bits.
-   In non-ECC mode, each port can be independently configured to any of the following depth/width: 64x18 or 128x9. In addition, all the ports can be configured to 128x12.
-   The registers in RAM64x18\_RT block have an option to mitigate Single-event transients.
-   There is an independent clock for each port. The memory will be triggered at the rising edge of the clock.
-   Read from both ports A and B at the same location is allowed.
-   Read and write on the same location at the same time results in unknown data to be read.
-   There is no collision prevention or detection. However, correct data are expected to be written into the memory.
-   When ECC is enabled, each port of the RAM64x18\_RT memory can raise flags to indicate single-bit-correct and double-bit-detect.

The following figure shows a simplified block diagram of the RAM64x18\_RT memory block and<br /> the following table gives the port descriptions. The simplified block illustrates the three<br /> independent read/write ports and the pipeline registers on the read port.
