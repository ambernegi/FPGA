# Exporting Interrupt Map Report

The **Export Interrupt Map Report** allows exporting the necessary data about<br /> the interrupt pin connections. It contains the data about MSS and MIV interrupt pins and<br /> their drivers. In particular, the hierarchical path to both pins, their instances, and the<br /> components where they are located. Besides for the connectivity information, the Platform<br /> Level Interrupt Controller \(PLIC\) number is also exporting for each MSS interrupt pin. The<br /> **Interrupt Map Report** functionality supports the<br /> **PFSOC\_MSS** components and the **MIV**<br /> processors.

To export the interrupt map report, perform the following steps:

1.  On the menu, click **File** &gt; **Export** &gt; **Export Interrupt Map Report**. The **Export Interrupt Map Report** dialog box appears.

2.  Click **OK**. A `.json` formatted interrupt map report file is created, which you can open in any text editor.

    **Note:** You can choose to the export the interrupt map to a different location and with a different filename as required.
