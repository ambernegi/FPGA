# check\_constraints

## Description

Checks<br /> all timing constraints in the current scenario for validity. This command performs<br /> the same checks as when the constraint is entered through SDC or Tcl.

When a constraint file is checked, the Constraint Checker does the following:

-   Checks the syntax.
-   Compares the design objects \(pins, cells, nets, ports\) in the constraint file versus the design objects in the netlist \(RTL or post-layout ADL netlist\). Any discrepancy \(for example, constraints on a design object which does not exist in the netlist\) are flagged as errors and reported in the `*_sdc.log` file.
