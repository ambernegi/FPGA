# Constraints Management

When a block with PDC constraints are imported into the top-level design, the blockâ€™s PDC constraints are captured and stored in two files:

-   `<top_level_module>.block.io.pdc` for the I/O PDC constraints.
-   `<top_level_module>.block.fp.pdc` for the floorplanning PDC constraints.

The `<top_level_module>.block.io.pdc` is displayed in the `I/O Attributes` tab of the Constraint Manager on top of any other IO PDC files.

The `<top_level_module>.block.fp.pdc`is displayed in the `Floor Planning` tab of the Constraint Manager on top of any other floorplanning PDC files.

**Note:** If you need to make any changes to the PDC files, go to the project where the blocks are created and published and make required changes. Make the floorplanning modifications and publish the block. Re-import the block into the top level. You may need to remove any duplicate blocks, at the top level after the re-import.
