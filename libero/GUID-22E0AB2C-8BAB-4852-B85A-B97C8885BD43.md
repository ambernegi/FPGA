# Running the Tcl

From Windows command-line, the following command runs the<br /> `libero.tcl` and creates the Libero SoC<br /> project.

``` {#CODEBLOCK_IST_2WK_4TB}
C:/Microchip/Libero/Designer/bin/libero.exe SCRIPT:<$Tcl_source_directory>/libero.tcl
```

After successful execution of Tcl script, the Libero project is created within the Tcl<br /> source directory.
