# Introduction

The PolarFire® SoC Microcontroller<br /> Subsystem \(MSS\) Configurator provides a graphical user interface that allows embedded<br /> software engineers to define the MSS start-up state quickly. It exports an XML file that<br /> is used by the embedded software flow that converts the XML into initialization<br /> constructs. Additionally, the tool outputs a CXZ file for inclusion into your Libero® design flow. The CXZ file contains information about<br /> metadata and port needed by the FPGA designer to complete the MSS and FPGA fabric<br /> connectivity.

MSS configurator is available as a stand-alone application and as part of the Libero SoC<br /> design tool suite. The information in this user guide applies to both.

**Important:** Older versions of this documentation uses the terms "Master" and "Slave." The equivalent Microchip terminology used in this document is "Initiator" and "Target" respectively.
