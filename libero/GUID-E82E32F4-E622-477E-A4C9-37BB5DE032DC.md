# Component Manifests

When you generate your components, a set of files is generated for each component. The<br /> Component Manifest report details the set of files generated and used in each subsequent<br /> step \(Synthesis, Simulation, Firmware Generation, and so on\). This report gives you the<br /> locations of all the generated files needed to proceed with the Custom Flow. You can<br /> access the component manifest in the **Reports** area: Click<br /> `Design > Reports` to open the **Reports**<br /> tab. In the **Reports** tab, you see a set of<br /> `manifest.txt` files \([Overview](GUID-1BA4CB4D-FE1F-4BF9-9865-B061E5938FCA.md)\), one for each component you<br /> generated.

**Tip:** You must set a component or module as '"root"' to see the component manifest file contents in the **Reports** tab.

Alternatively, you can access the individual manifest report files for each core<br /> component generated or SmartDesign component from<br /> `<project>/component/work/<component name>/<instance name>/<component name>_manifest.txt` or<br /> `<project>/component/work/<SmartDesign name>/<SmartDesign name>_manifest.txt`. You can also access the manifest file contents of<br /> each component generated from the new **Components** tab in Libero,<br /> where the file locations are mentioned with respect to the project directory.

Focus on the following Component Manifest reports:

-   If you instantiated cores into a SmartDesign, read the file `<smartdesign_name>_manifest.txt`.
-   If you created components for cores, read the `<core_component_name>_manifest.txt`.

You must use all [Component Manifests](GUID-E82E32F4-E622-477E-A4C9-37BB5DE032DC.md#)<br /> reports that apply to your design. For example, if your project has a SmartDesign with<br /> one or more core components instantiated in it and you intend to use them all in your<br /> final design, then you must select files listed in the [Component Manifests](GUID-E82E32F4-E622-477E-A4C9-37BB5DE032DC.md#) reports of all those components<br /> for use in your design flow.
