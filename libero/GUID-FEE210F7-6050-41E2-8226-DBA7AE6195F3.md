# set\_location

This PDC command assigns the specified macro to a particular location on the<br /> chip.

<br />

```
set_location -inst_name <macro_inst_name> -fixed <true|false> -x <integer> -y <integer>
```

<br />

**Note:** This command may not honor placing globals to physical locations on the die. Instead of placing globals on die locations, let the Libero Design Suite decide where to place the global buffers.

## Arguments

-inst\_name
:   Specifies the instance name of the macro in the netlist to assign to a particular location on the chip.

-fixed &lt;true \| false&gt;
:   Sets whether the location of this instance is fixed \(that is,<br /> locked\). Locked instances are not moved during layout. The default is YES.

    The following table lists the acceptable values for this argument.

    |Value|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |True|The location of this instance is<br /> locked.|
    |False|The location of this instance is<br /> unlocked.|

-x -y
:   The x and y coordinates specify where to place the macro on the chip. Use the Chip Planner tool to determine the x and y coordinates of the location.

## Exceptions

None

## Example

This example assigns and locks the macro with the name<br /> `mem_data_in\[57\]`at the location x = 7, y = 2:

<br />

```
set_location -inst_name mem_data_in\[57\] -fixed true -x 7 -y 2
```

<br />

## DDR3 Memory Placement

DDR3 memory must be placed in specific locations on the PolarFire chip to<br /> meet timing requirements. For DDR3 memory placement, the `set_location`<br /> command has the following syntax:

<br />

```
set_location -inst_name <hierarchical path to DDR instance> -location <edge>_<anchor>
```

<br />

-inst\_name &lt;hierarchical path to DDR instance&gt;
:   Specifies the hierarchical path to the DDR instance.

-location &lt;edge&gt;\_&lt;anchor&gt;
:   Specifies the `edge_anchor` location.

## Example

```
set_location -inst_name {DDR3_TOP/DDR3_0}\ -location {NORTH_NE}
```

The maximum DDR width varies with the die/package combinations and the<br /> location they are placed in. See the following table for the correct location to place the<br /> DDR3 memory. The numbers in the table refer to the maximum DDR3 width.

|Die/Package|Location \(Edge\_Anchor\}<br /> Edge=\{NORTH/SOUTH/WEST\}, Anchor=\{NE/NW/SE/SW\}|
|NORTH\_NE|NORTH\_NW|SOUTH\_SE|SOUTH\_SW|WEST\_NW|WEST\_SW|
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
|MPF200/FULLPKGE|16|16|Invalid Loc|40|64|40|
|MPF300/FCG1152|64|72|16|40|72|64|
|MPF300/FCG484|8|8|Invalid Loc|32|Invalid Loc|16|
|MPF300/FCVG484|16|16|Invalid Loc|40|16|16|
