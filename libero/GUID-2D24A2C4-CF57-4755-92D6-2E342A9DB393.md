# Memory Interface View Columns

The Memory Interface view detects the type of Memory Interface in the<br /> design and presents the ports in the Ports View. The Memory Interface view displays the<br /> following I/O information in the view. Each of the column can be sorted<br /> \(ascending/descending order\) or filtered:

-   Port Function—Formal port name of the Memory Interface. The ports specific to the memory interface type are loaded into the Port View.
-   Port Name—Port name of the Memory Interface instance in the design.
-   Pin Number—Package pin number assigned to the port of the Memory Interface.
-   Function—More descriptive function name of the Port, which identifies the type of I/O \(for example, HSIO for High-speed I/Os or GPIO \(General-purpose Input/Output\).
-   Max Memory Width—Maximum memory width of the DDR. This is a fixed read-only value specific to the Edge\_Anchor and is different with different Edge\_Anchors.
-   Max Data Rate—Maximum data rate in Mbps. This is a fixed read-only value specific to the Edge\_Anchor and is different with different Edge\_Anchors.

**Note:** When making DDR placement, see the memory width and data rate of the DDR Memory used in the design \(as displayed in the Ports View\). Make sure that the Edge\_Anchor location, where you want to place the DDR memory, can accommodate the DDR memory in terms of the memory width and the data rate. This will avoid invalid placement.

-   Bank Name—the I/O bank name of the port
-   High-speed I/O Clocks—specifies the number of High Speed I/O clocks

The Pin Number and Function are the same as what are listed in the PPAT<br /> for the selected device and package. The PPAT for each PolarFire package are provided in<br /> the PolarFire\_&lt;package&gt; Pinouts file on the [PolarFire Documentation](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas/polarfire-fpgas#documentation) web page.
