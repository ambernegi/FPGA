# Blocks and Floorplanning

When creating a block, floorplanning is essential if you plan to publish the placement information. Before running Layout on the block, you must have the floorplan of the design block. You can use Chip Planner or PDC commands for floorplanning.

If you do not create a region and constrain the block to the region \(floorplanning \) or lock the macros before place and route, a warning message appears when you publish the block. The message warns you that not all macros in the block have been constrained to regions or locked. Therefore, only your design netlist is exported when the block is published.
