# Clamp Diode

PolarFire devices have internal PCI clamp diodes for both HSIO and GPIO. PCI clamp diodes help reduce the voltage level at the input, and are mainly used when the voltage overshoot exceeds the maximum allowable limit. If signaling levels of the receiver are greater than the VDDIx of the bank, the clamp diode must be off to support hot-socketing insertion.

For GPIO, use this field to program the clamp diode to be ON or OFF.

For HSIO, the internal clamp diode is always ON by default.
