# Introduction

As Field Programmable Gate Array \(FPGA\) designs grow in size and<br /> complexity, it has become essential for FPGA designers to traverse the netlist to<br /> analyze their designs. The Microchip Netlist Viewer is a graphical representation of the<br /> design netlist that displays different views for the different stages of the design<br /> process.
