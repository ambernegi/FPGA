# Post-Layout Macros

## GB

It is a Post-layout macro that stands for Global Buffer. The global clock network is composed of global buffers \(GBs\) for clock distribution. GBs distribute clocks to the left/right half of the fabric through vertical clock stripes. Each GB drives an independent half-chip global clock \(GCLK\). Two GBsâ€”one from each half, are instantiated by the Libero SoC PolarFire to distribute a clock to the entire FPGA fabric. There are a total of 24 full-chip global signals and 48 half-chip global signals that may be used in a design. The half-chip globals can be driven by up to 24 fabric routed signals. Clocks driven from regular I/Os, internally generated clocks, and high fan-out signals such as resets can be routed to GBs.

|An|ENn|q \(internal signal\)|YNn|YSn|

|1|0|1|1|1|
|1|1|0|1|1|
|0|X|q|!q|!q|

## RGB

It is a Post-layout macro. Each GB drives row global buffers \(RGBs\) present on the vertical clock stripes to reach the logic sectors. Each RGB selects a global clock, a regional clock, or a fabric routed clock to drive the logic sectors located on the left or right side of the vertical clock stripe. RGBs are situated on the vertical stripes of the global network architecture inside the FPGA fabric. The global signals from the GBs are routed to the RGBs. Each RGB is independent and can be driven by fabric routing in addition to being driven by GBs. This facilitates the use of RGBs to drive regional clocks spanning a small fabric area, such as the the clock network for SERDES.

## CC\_CONFIG

The CC\_CONFIG macro is a Post-layout macro that is responsible for generating the Carry bit for each ARI1\_CC cell in the cluster. CI and CO are the carry-in and carry-out, respectively, to the cell. The intermediate carry-bits are given by CC\[11:0\]. The functionality of the CC\_CONFIG is evaluating CC using CC\[n\] = !Px!Y3+PxCC\[n-1\] where, CC\[-1\] is CI and CC\[12\] is CO.

A single post-layout macro for IOINFF, IOUTFF, and IOEFF. The IOD block includes registers for data-in, data-out, and output enable signals. The input registers \(IOINFF\) provide the registered version of the input signals from the IOA to the FPGA fabric. The output registers \(IOUTFF\) provide the registered version of the output signals from the FPGA fabric to the IOA. The output enable register \(IOENFF\) acts as a control signal for the output if the I/O is configured as tri-stated or bidirectional. These registers in IOD blocks are similar to the D-type flip-flops available in fabric logic elements.

It is a Post-layout macro. Each PLL has a programmable delay line that can be configured in the reference clock path or feedback clock path. For PLLs, adding delay in the reference clock path enables clock delay, and adding delay in the feedback clock path enables clock advancement with respect to the reference clock. The PLL must be configured in external feedback mode to add the delay line in the feedback path.
