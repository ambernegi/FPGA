# Programming Job

A Programming Job is a set of data used by programming systems for device programming in HSM and<br /> non-HSM flows.

The current SPPS ecosystem supports FlashPro Express and IHP job types.

FlashPro Express can program HSM and non-HSM jobs \(refer to the [FlashPro Express User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/flashpro_express_ug.pdf)\), and IHP supports the HSM job type only.

A Programming Job contains the following data:

-   Job type \(FlashPro Express or IHP\)
-   Job origin
-   Bitstream\(s\) for various programming actions \(PROGRAM, ERASE, and VERIFY\)
-   Hardware setup information – for FlashPro Express job type
    -   Type of hardware interface \(JTAG in this version of the Job Manager\)
    -   Configuration
-   Job device\(s\) – includes basic device information
-   Data for HSM flow only
    -   M-HSM UUID
    -   U-HSM UUID
        -   Encrypted Job Tickets authorizing programming actions and overbuild protection under control of the HSM
        -   Encrypted keys and security protocol data required by HSM protocols
