# Variables

With Tcl scripting, you can store a value in a variable for later use. You use the<br /> set command to assign variables. For example, the following set command creates a<br /> variable named x and sets its initial value to 10.

```
set x 10
```

A variable can be a letter, a digit, an underscore, or any combination of letters,<br /> digits, and underscore characters. All variable values are stored as strings.

In the Tcl language, you do not declare variables or their types. Any variable can<br /> hold any value. Use the dollar sign \(`$`\) to obtain the value of a<br /> variable, for example:

```
set a 1 
set b $a
set cmd expr 
set x 11
$cmd $x*$x
```

The dollar sign `$` tells Tcl to handle the letters and digits<br /> following it as a variable name and to substitute the variable name with its value.

## Global Variables

Variables can be declared global in scope using the Tcl global command. All<br /> procedures, including the declaration can access and modify global variables, for<br /> example:

```
global myvar
```
