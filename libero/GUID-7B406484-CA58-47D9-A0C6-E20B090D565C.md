# Misc

Use the **Misc** tab to enable the following options:

-   Trace functionality
-   JTAG \(Debug\) functionality
-   Interrupts to/from MSS
-   Configuring GPIO Interrupt Register
-   Exposing Boot Status ports
-   Exposing feedback ports to fabric

For more information, see [PolarFire SoC FPGA MSS Technical Reference Manual](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/ReferenceManuals/PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_MSS_Technical_Reference_Manual_VC.pdf).

By default, these options are marked as **Unused**. When any of the<br /> options are enabled, the corresponding ports are exposed on the MSS block \(see the<br /> following figure\).

**Boot Status**: When **Expose Boot Status ports**<br /> option is selected, the ports `BOOT_FAIL_CLEAR_F2M` and<br /> `BOOT_FAIL_ERROR_M2F` are exposed as shown in the following figure.<br /> Both the signals typically represent binary states through voltage levels and are<br /> generally synchronous with the MSS clock.

`Boot_fail_error_M2F` is a signal from the MSS to the FPGA fabric that<br /> indicates a boot failure has occurred. When the MSS detects the failure, it sets this<br /> signal high and informs the fabric to take action or log the issue.

`Boot_Fail_Clear_F2M` is a signal from the FPGA fabric to inform the MSS<br /> that the boot failure has been addressed. When the FPGA fabric handles the issue, it<br /> sets the signal high telling the MSS to clear the boot failure status.

**MSS Feedback and Debug Ports**: This option is only available for<br /> production devices. If selected, a group of `MSS_FEEDBACK_DEBUG` ports<br /> are exposed as shown in the following figure.

**Important:** In a Libero project, when System Controller Suspend Mode is enabled \(**Project** &gt; **Project Settings** &gt; **Device settings**\), the `PFSOC_SCSM` macro must be instantiated in the user design and the `REBOOT_REQUESTED_M2F` pin of MSS must be connected to the `SC_WAKE` pin of `PFSOC_SCSM` macro to wake up the system controller temporarily so it can reboot the MSS during normal operation.
