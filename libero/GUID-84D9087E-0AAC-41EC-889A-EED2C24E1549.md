# Appendix Bâ€”Sample SDC and PDC Constraints

For certain IP cores such as CCC, OSC, CoreResetP, and CoreConfigP, Libero SoC generates SDC and<br /> PDC timing constraints. Passing the SDC and/or PDC constraints to design tools increases<br /> the chance of meeting timing closure with less effort and fewer design iterations. The<br /> full hierarchical path from the top-level instance is given for all design objects<br /> referenced in the constraints.
