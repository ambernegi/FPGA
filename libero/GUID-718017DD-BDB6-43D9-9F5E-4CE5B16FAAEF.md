# Libero SoC Project Creation

Some design steps must be run inside the Libero SoC environment \([Table â€€ 1](GUID-1BA4CB4D-FE1F-4BF9-9865-B061E5938FCA.md#TABLE_ZCQ_X5W_Z5B)\). For these steps to run, you must create two Libero SoC projects. The first project<br /> is used for design component configuration and generation, and the second project is for<br /> the physical implementation of the top-level design.
