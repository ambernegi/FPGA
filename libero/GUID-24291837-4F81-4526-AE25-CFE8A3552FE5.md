# Clock Domains

-   **Include inter-clock domains in calculations for timing analysis**: Allows you to specify whether SmartTime must use inter-clock domains in calculations for timing analysis. By default, this option is checked.
-   **Enable recovery and removal checks**: Allows SmartTime to check removal and recovery time on asynchronous signals. Additional sets are created in each clock domain in Analysis View to report the corresponding paths.
