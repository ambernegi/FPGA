# Introduction

SmartTime is a Libero® SoC interactive gate-level static timing<br /> analysis tool that allows you to visualize and identify timing issues in your designs.<br /> Using this tool, you can evaluate how close you are to meeting your timing requirements,<br /> create custom sets to track, set timing exceptions to obtain timing closure, and define<br /> cross-probe paths with other tools. Key SmartTime features allow you to:

-   Perform complete timing analysis of your design to ensure that your designs meet all timing constraints and operate at the desired speed, with the appropriate amount of margin across all operating conditions.
-   Browse through your design’s various clock domains to examine the timing paths and identify those that violate your timing requirements.
-   Create customizable timing reports.
-   Navigate directly to the paths responsible for violating your timing requirements.

**Note:** Creating and editing timing constraints are handled in a separate Timing Constraints Editor. For more information, see the [Timing Constraints Editor User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/smarttime_ce_ug.pdf).
