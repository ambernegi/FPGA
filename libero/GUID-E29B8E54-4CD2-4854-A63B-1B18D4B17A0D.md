# Introduction

FlashPro Express is Microchip’s programming software tool designed from the ground up to<br /> address secured programming assurance in production programming house environments.<br /> FlashPro Express software supports PolarFire®, PolarFire SoC, SmartFusion® 2, IGLOO® 2, and RTG4™ in Windows® and Linux® OS<br /> environments, using the FlashPro Programmer hardware.

You can install FlashPro Express two ways:

-   **Integrated with Libero**- FlashPro Express installs automatically when Libero® is installed. FlashPro Express is used by Libero to perform the programming tasks for PolarFire, PolarFire SoC, SmartFusion 2, IGLOO 2, and RTG4, as part of the design flow.
-   **Stand-alone**- FlashPro Express is also available as a stand-alone installation. This installation method is primarily used for production programming or lab programming on machines that do not require a full version of Libero.

## Supported Device Families

The following table lists the device families and their derivatives that FlashPro<br /> Express can program directly through Libero or by exporting a FlashPro Express<br /> job.

|Device Family|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|PolarFire®|Lowest power, cost optimized mid-range solution.|
|PolarFire SoC|Lowest power, multi-core RISC-V SoC FPGA.|
|SmartFusion® 2|Addresses fundamental requirements for advanced security, high<br /> reliability, and low power in critical industrial, military,<br /> aviation, communications, and medical applications.|
|IGLOO® 2|Low-power mixed-signal programmable solution.|
|RTG4™|Radiation-tolerant programmable solution.|
