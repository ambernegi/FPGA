# Simulating an FPGA Design Interacting with MSS

The MSS simulation model has been designed to verify that the connectivity to the MSS<br /> has been properly established with the FPGA fabric logic.

The MSS simulation model can be used to verify:

-   The Fabric—MSS connectivity using the Fabric Interface Controllers \(FICs\).
-   The Fabric—MSS interrupt \(M2F and F2M\) interface.

For information about how to set up and run the simulation for the PolarFire SoC MSS,<br /> see [MSS Simulation User Guide for PolarFire SoC](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/pfsoc_mss_sim_ug.pdf).
