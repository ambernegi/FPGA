# Interpreting Manifest Files

When you open a component manifest file, you see paths to files in your Libero project<br /> and pointers on where in the design flow to use them. You might see the following types<br /> of files in a manifest file:

-   HDL source files for all Synthesis and Simulation tools
-   Stimulus files for all Simulation tools
-   Constraint files

Following is the Component Manifest of a PolarFire core<br /> component.

``` {#CODEBLOCK_LPG_MMX_Z5B}
HDL source files for all Synthesis and Simulation tools:
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/Actel/SgCore/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES/3.0.100/rtl/vlog/core/CoreSysServices_PF_APBS.v
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/Actel/SgCore/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES/3.0.100/rtl/vlog/core/CoreSysServices_PF_Ctrl.v
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/Actel/SgCore/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES/3.0.100/rtl/vlog/core/CoreSysServices_PF_ReqArbiter.v
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/Actel/SgCore/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES/3.0.100/rtl/vlog/core/CoreSysServices_PF_MBXIF.v
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/Actel/SgCore/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES/3.0.100/rtl/vlog/core/CoreSysServices_PF_SSIIF.v
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/work/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES_C0/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES_C0_0/rtl/vlog/core/PF_System_Services.v
    D:/Designs/manifestex/component/work/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES_C0/PF_SYSTEM_SERVICES_C0.v

```

Each type of file is necessary downstream in your design flow. The following sections<br /> describe integration of the files from the manifest into your design flow.
