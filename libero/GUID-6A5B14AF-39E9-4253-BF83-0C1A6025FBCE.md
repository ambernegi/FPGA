# Introduction

In the FPGA design world, constraint files are as important as design<br /> source files. Physical Design Constraints \(PDC\) are used to constrain I/O attributes,<br /> placement, and routing during the physical layout phase.

You can enter PDC commands manually using the<br /> Libero®<br /> SoC Text Editor. PDC commands can also be generated by the Libero SoC interactive tools.<br /> The I/O Attribute Editor is the interactive tool for making the I/O attributes changes, and<br /> the Chip Planner is the interactive tool for making the floor-planning changes. When<br /> changes are made in the I/O Attribute Editor or the Chip Planner, the PDC file\(s\) are<br /> updated to reflect these changes. These PDC commands<br /> are<br /> used as part of a script file to constrain the Place-and-Route step of your design.

## Supported Families

This user guide describes the I/O and floorplanning PDC commands<br /> applicable to PolarFire® and PolarFire SoC FPGA devices.
