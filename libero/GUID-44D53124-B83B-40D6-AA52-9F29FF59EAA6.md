# Managing Place and Route and Globals

This option is available only when the **Block Creation** option is enabled \(**__Project__ &gt; __Project Settings__ &gt; __Design Flow__ &gt; __Enable Block Creation__**\).

The Place-and-Route tool has an option to limit the number of row globals used for block creation.

To use this option:

1.  From the `Design Flow` window, right-click **Place and Route**and choose **Configure Options**.

    The Layout Options dialog box shows the default number of row-global resources for the technology family.

2.  Enter a value to restrict the number of row-global resources available in every half-row of the device. During Place and Route of the block, the tool will not exceed this capacity on any half-row. The default value is the maximum number of row globals. If you enter a value lower than the maximum capacity \(the default\), the layout of the block will be able to integrate with the rest of the design if the remaining row-global capacity is consumed.
