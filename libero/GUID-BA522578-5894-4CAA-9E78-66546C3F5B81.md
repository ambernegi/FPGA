# Operating Modes

The Floorplanner View has two operating modes. Click the **Macro Manipulation Mode**button to switch between Macro Manipulation<br /> Mode and Region Manipulation modes:

-   **Macro Manipulation Mode**. Use this mode to work with macros, such as assigning macros to location or unassigning placed macros from locations. You can also view properties of selected macros in the Floorplanner View from the properties window. You can select multiple macros by pressing the **CTRL** key and selecting required macros.
-   **Region Manipulation Mode**. Use this mode to work on regions such as resizing, renaming, or deleting regions, or assigning and unassigning macros or nets to regions.
