# Appendix Aâ€”Sample SDC Constraints

Libero SoC generates SDC timing constraints for certain IP cores, such as CCC, OSC,<br /> Transceiver and so on. Passing the SDC constraints to design tools increases the chance<br /> of meeting timing closure with less effort and fewer design iterations. The full<br /> hierarchical path from the top-level instance is given for all design objects referenced<br /> in the constraints.
