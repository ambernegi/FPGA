# Displaying the Flat Post-Compile Cone View

When the Flat Post-Compile Cone view has finished loading, unlike the other three views, nothing is drawn in the canvas.

This view is useful when a small or critical part of a very large design<br /> needs to be examined. Design objects that can be selected for display in this view<br /> include:

-   Nets
-   Ports
-   Macros
-   Components

To display design objects in the Flat Post-Compiled Cone view, right<br /> click the design object \(**Nets, Macro, Ports, or Component**\) in the<br /> Design Tree and select **Load Selection**. The design object is added<br /> to the view.

Opening a design in the Flat Post-Compile view may incur a runtime<br /> penalty. This cone view loads the same AFL netlist source file as the Flat Post-Compile<br /> view. However, this cone view, unlike the Flat Post-Compile view, draws nothing until<br /> you select a part of the design you want to display. This reduces the runtime penalty<br /> associated with drawing a large netlist for display.
