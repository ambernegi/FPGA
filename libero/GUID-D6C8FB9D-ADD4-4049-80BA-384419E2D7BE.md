# Introduction

The SmartDesign tool is a visual block-based design creation and entry tool for<br /> instantiating, configuring, and connecting Microchip IPs, user-generated IPs, and custom<br /> and glue-logic HDL modules. The tool provides a canvas for stitching together the<br /> various design components.

The resulting HDL from the SmartDesign tool is a Design-Rule-Checked \(DRC\) and<br /> synthesis-ready HDL file. A generated SmartDesign can be the entire FPGA design or a<br /> component subsystem to be reused in a larger design.

The SmartDesign canvas instantiates the following design objects:

-   Microchip IP cores
-   User-generated or third-party IP cores
-   HDL modules
-   HDL parameterized core modules
-   Basic macros
-   Other SmartDesign components
-   Reusable design blocks published from the LiberoÂ® SoC Design Suite

The SmartDesign tool provides the following features for effortless design<br /> creation and visualization:

-   Addition of synthesis attributes to design objects
-   Visualization of the memory map of the design
-   Smart Search and Connect tool for fast design look-up and connectivity for complex designs
-   Smart Search and Filter to create focused cones of the design on the canvas
