### Project Menu

The following table describes the menu options in the **Project**<br /> menu.

|Menu Option|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|New Project|Creates a new SmartDebug project.|
|Open Project|Opens an existing debug project.|
|Execute Script|Executes SmartDebug-specific Tcl scripts.|
|Export Script File|Exports SmartDebug-specific commands to a script file.|
|Recent Projects|Lists recent SmartDebug projects.|

### Log Window

The following table describes the tabs on the **Log** view in the<br /> standalone SmartDebug window. This view appears when you start SmartDebug. To hide it,<br /> click **View** &gt; **View Log**.

|Tab|Description|
|---|-----------|
|Messages|Displays standard output messages.|
|Errors|Displays error messages.|
|Warnings|Displays warning messages.|
|Info|Displays general information.|

### Tools Menu

The Tools menu includes Programming Connectivity and Interface and Programmer Settings options, which are enabled after creating or opening a SmartDebug project.

<br />

**Attention:** When the **Discrete Clocking** mode is selected, a warning pop-up appears, which states that using the Discrete Clocking TCK mode will increase the programming time significantly, as shown in the following figure.

![](GUID-F4C94DBC-D497-4513-A5A7-449CE4925E12-low.png "Programmer Settings Warning Pop-Up")

After the pop-up is closed by the user, a warning icon with a message tooltip<br /> appears next to the **Discrete Clocking** radio button. The icon<br /> and the tooltip appear when the programmer settings dialog is re-opened.

<br />

For more information, see [Programming Connectivity and Interface](GUID-593F19AE-C1E3-4819-8BB0-65929625C4A5.md#).

## Programming Connectivity and Interface

To open the Programming Connectivity and Interface dialog box from the standalone<br /> SmartDebug Tools menu, choose **Programming Connectivity and Interface**. The Programming Connectivity and Interface dialog box<br /> displays the physical chain from TDI to TDO.

![???](GUID-9520891C-4848-4B6F-9EDC-878B878F1034-low.jpg "Programming Connectivity and Interface Dialog Box – Project Created Using Import from DDC File")

All devices in the chain are disabled by default when a standalone SmartDebug project is<br /> created using the **Construct Automatically** option in the Create<br /> SmartDebug Project dialog box.

**Note:** SmartDebug displays a pop-up window if it detects an outdated FlashPro6 programmer. You can then choose to update the programmer design.

<br />

<br />

The following table describes the actions available in the Programming Connectivity and<br /> Interface dialog box.

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Construct Chain Automatically|Construct the physical chain automatically. Running Construct<br /> Chain Automatically in the Programming Connectivity and Interface<br /> removes all existing debug/programming data included using<br /> DDC/programming files. The project is the same as a new project<br /> created using the Construct Chain Automatically option|
|Scan and Check Chain|Scan the physical chain connected to the programmer and check if<br /> it matches the chain constructed in the scan chain block<br /> diagram.|
|Run Programming Action|Program the device with the selected programming procedure. When<br /> two devices are connected in the chain, the programming actions are<br /> independent of the device.|
|Zoom In|Zoom into the scan chain block diagram.|
|Zoom Out|Zoom out of the scan chain block diagram.|

### Hover Information

The device tooltip displays the Libero design device information if you hover the cursor over a<br /> device in the scan chain block diagram

![???](GUID-8C015A2B-9E68-426A-A37F-3979FB95D2AF-low.jpg "Libero Design Device Information")

The following table describes each Libero design device information option.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Name|User-specified device name. This field indicates the unique name<br /> specified by the user in the Device Name field in Configure Device<br /> \(right click **Properties**\).|
|Device|Microchip device name.|
|Programming File|Programming file name.|
|Programming Action|The programming action selected for the device in the chain when a<br /> programming file is loaded.|
|IR|Device instruction length.|
|TCK|Maximum clock frequency in MHz to program a specific device;<br /> standalone SmartDebug uses this information to ensure that the<br /> programmer operates at a frequency lower than the slowest device in the<br /> chain.|

### Device Chain Details

The device within the chain has the following details:

-   User-specified device name
-   Device name
-   Programming file name
-   Programming action: Select **Enable Device for Programming**to enable the device for programming. Enabled devices are green, and disabled devices are grayed out.

### Context Menu Options

The following options are available when you right click a device \(context menu\) in the<br /> Programming Connectivity and Interface dialog box.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Set as Libero Design Device

</td><td>

The user must set the Libero design device when there are multiple<br /> identical Libero design devices in the chain.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configure Device

</td><td>

Ability to reconfigure the device.-   Family and Die: The device can be explicitly configured from the Family, Die drop-down.
-   Device Name: Editable field for providing user-specified name for the device.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Import Debug Data from DDC File

</td><td>

Option to import debug data information from the DDC file.**Note:** This option is supported when SmartDebug is invoked in Standalone mode.

The DDC<br /> file selected for import into device must be created for a<br /> compatible device. When the DDC file is imported successfully,<br /> all current device debug data is removed and replaced with debug<br /> data from the imported DDC file.

The JTAG Chain<br /> configuration from the imported DDC file is ignored in this<br /> option.

If a programming file is already loaded into the<br /> device prior to importing debug data from the DDC file, the<br /> programming file content is replaced with the content of the DDC<br /> file \(if programming file information is included in the DDC<br /> file\).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>### Debug Context Save

Debug context refers to the user selections in debug options such as Debug FPGA Array, Debug<br /> Transceiver, and View Flash Memory Content. In standalone SmartDebug, the debug context of the<br /> current session is saved or reset depending on the user actions in Programming Connectivity<br /> and Interface.

The debug context of the current session is retained for the following actions in Programming Connectivity and Interface:

-   Enable Device for Programming
-   Select Programming Procedure/Actions
-   Scan and Check Chain
-   Run Programming Action

The debug context of the current session is reset for the following actions in Programming<br /> Connectivity and Interface:

-   Auto Construct: Clears all the existing debug data. You need to re-import the debug data from DDC file.
-   Import Debug Data from DDC file
-   Configure Device: Renames the device in the chain
-   Configure Device: Family/Die change
-   Load Programming File

### Selecting Devices for Debug

Standalone SmartDebug provides an option to select the devices connected in the JTAG chain for<br /> debug. Click the **Device** drop-down list to select the device. The<br /> device debug context is not saved when another debug device is selected.

## View Device Status

Click **View Device Status**in the standalone SmartDebug main window to display the Device Status Report. The Device Status Report is a complete summary of IDCode, device certificate, design information, programming information, digest, and device security information.
