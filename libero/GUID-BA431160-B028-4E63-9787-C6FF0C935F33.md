# Overview

This section provides an overview of FlashPro Express.

## FlashPro Hardware Programmers

The FlashPro series of hardware programmers consists of:

-   FlashPro3/X
-   FlashPro4
-   FlashPro5
-   FlashPro6

All FlashPro series hardware programmers save board space because a<br /> single JTAG chain can be used for all JTAG devices. In-system programming<br /> using the JTAG port adds the flexibility of field upgrades or post-assembly<br /> production-line characterization. Production costs are reduced significantly<br /> as a result of elimination of expensive sockets on the board.

**Important:** FlashPro5 and FlashPro6 support programming though a device SPI Target port.

## Secure Job Programming

Job programming is the concept of using a single file to program a Microchip device or chain of<br /> Microchip devices using encrypted bitstreams.

The single job file contains all of the information necessary to setup FlashPro Express as well<br /> as the encrypted bitstream images for the devices in the job. After a job file is<br /> created, it can be passed securely to production programming houses or contract<br /> engineering facilities to load the Microchip images during manufacturing. Job projects<br /> can be exported from Libero and imported into stand-alone FlashPro Express, providing a<br /> clean delineation between design flow and production programming.

## Migrating FlashPro Projects to FlashPro Express

Existing FlashPro projects \(`*.pro`\) files are called Job Project files in<br /> FlashPro Express. These Job Projects can be opened with FlashPro Express to take<br /> advantage of Linux programming support and the simplified tool targeted for operators in<br /> a production floor environment.

<br />

**Note:** FlashPro projects that were created in single mode are not supported by this tool. Microchip recommends that you convert these projects to chain mode projects.

<br />

To convert the project to a chain project:

1.  Open the FlashPro project \(`*.pro`\) in FlashPro.
2.  Locate the loaded STAPL file by one of two methods:

    The log prints **STAPL file ‘&lt;stapl\_path&gt;’ has been loaded successfully**. **&lt;stapl\_path&gt;**<br /> is the location of the STAPL file loaded.

    ![???](GUID-4DFE9480-2D57-44DF-9397-45FC47C728F1-low.jpg "Sample Log Message")


In the Single Device Configuration window, the field<br /> **STAPL\_FILE\_NAME** shows the location of the STAPL file<br /> loaded.

1.  Switch the project to chain mode using one of the two methods:
    -   Press the chain button from the toolbar: ![???](GUID-3A81346E-17BF-4466-927B-CABC0BCF6F9D-low.jpg)
    -   From the **Tools** menu, select **Mode &gt; Chain Programming**.
2.  Load the STAPL file in chain mode by adding a Microchip device in the chain.
    1.  From the **File** menu, select **Configuration &gt; Add Microchip Devices from Files**.
    2.  Browse to the location of the STAPL file and click **Open**.
3.  To save the project, from the **File** menu, select **Save Project**.

You can now open the project using FlashPro Express.

When moving FlashPro project \(`*.pro`\) files to another machine, Microchip<br /> recommends that you archive the entire project folder, copy it to the new machine,<br /> extract it locally, and then load the job project within FlashPro Express. FlashPro<br /> Express opens a job project only when a programmer is connected to the machine, at least<br /> one Microchip device has programmed enabled, and all enabled Microchip devices have a<br /> bitstream file loaded.
