# Publishing Content

When a block is published, Libero exports the `<design>.cxz` file to the `<project folder>/designer/<design_block_name>/export` folder. The `<design>.cxz` file is a zip file that contains the files listed in the table:

|File|Description|
|----|-----------|
|`<design_block_name>_syn.v` \| `<design_block_name>_syn.vhd`|Timing shell file passed to the Synthesis tools when the top-level design is synthesized. The block is marked and treated as a black box when the top-level design is synthesized.|
|`<design_block_name>_sim.v` \| `<design_block_name>_sim.vhd`|Structural HDL netlist for post-synthesis simulation of the block.|
|`header_report.log`|Log file that contains header information on what and how a block is published including the options you selected to configure the publication.|
|`<design_block_name>_compile_netlist_resources.xml`|Compile report that details resource usage, device information, and a list of high-fanout nets.|
|`<design_block_name>_gp_report.xml`|Global Place and Route report.|
|`<design_block_name>_compile_netlist_combinational_loops.xml`|Combinational Loops report.|
|`<design>.cdb`|Internal proprietary file contains the optimized netlist, Place and Route, or the timing constraint information.|
|`<design_block_name>.sdc`|Contains the SDC constraints for the block to be used for Timing Verifications.|
|`<design_block_name>.cxz`|The published block. You can move it to another folder, transfer it to other team members, and so on. This file is imported into the top-level design when you want to instantiate the block.|
