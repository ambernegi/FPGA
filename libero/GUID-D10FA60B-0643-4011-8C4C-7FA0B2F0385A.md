# Component Configuration Using Libero

After selecting the components that must be used from the preceding list, perform the<br /> following steps:

1.  Create a new Libero project \(Core Configuration and Generation\): Select the Device and Family that you target your final design to.
2.  Use one or more of the cores mentioned in [Custom Flow](GUID-63C667EB-C47A-4396-AEF9-E2849595AD73.md).
    1.  Create a SmartDesign and configure the desired core and instantiate it in the SmartDesign component.
    2.  Promote all the pins to top level.
    3.  Generate the SmartDesign.
    4.  Double click the **Simulate** tool \(any of Pre-Synthesis or Post-Synthesis or Post-Layout options\) to invoke the simulator. You can exit the simulator after it is invoked. This step generates the simulation files necessary for your project.

        **Tip:** You must perform this step if you want to simulate your design outside Libero.

        For more information, see [Simulating Your Design](GUID-C4D1CEE3-DBEB-41DA-9682-36DDA1CD970C.md).

    5.  Save your projectâ€”this is your reference project.
