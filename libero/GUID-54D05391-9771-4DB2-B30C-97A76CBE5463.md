# export\_pin\_reports

## Description

This Tcl command configures and exports a pin report file to a specified folder/directory location. The pin report lists the pins in your device sorted according to your preference: sort by Port Name or Sorted by Package Pin Name. The pin report generates two files:

-   &lt;design&gt;\_pinrpt\_name.rpt - pin report sorted by name.
-   &lt;design&gt;\_pinrpt\_number.rpt - pin report sorted by pin number.

Export Pin Report generates a Bank Report by default; the filename is `<design>-bankrpt.rpt`. Export Pin Report also generates an I/O Register Combining Report listing the I/Os which have been combined into a Register for getting timing performance. You must select at least one report.

```
export_pin_reports -export_dir {absolute path to folder location} \
                   [-pin_report_by_name {value}] \
                   [-pin_report_by_pkg_pin {value}] \
                   [-bank_report {1|0}] \
                   [-io_report {1|0}]
