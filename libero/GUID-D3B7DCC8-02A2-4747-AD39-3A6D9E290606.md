# Netlist Viewer—Hier

The Post-Synthesis Hierarchical View \(Netlist Viewer—Hier\) is a<br /> hierarchical view of the netlist after synthesis and after technology mapping to the<br /> Microchip FPGA technology. Click on the Canvas to load the "Hierarchical view" in Nelist<br /> Viewer—Hier. The Chip Planner loads the netlist into the system memory and displays it in<br /> the window.

When the netlist is loaded for the first time into memory, a pop-up progress bar indicates the progress of the loading process, which may incur some runtime penalty for a large netlist.
