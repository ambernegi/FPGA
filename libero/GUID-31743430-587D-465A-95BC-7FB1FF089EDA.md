# HSM Server Functionality

SPPS uses the User and Manufacturer HSM server types.

The User HSM allows the OE to generate keys and use them to generate programming bitstreams.

**Parent topic:**[HSM Servers](GUID-8655628F-64C1-4EED-AA0C-2F15C461DFAB.md)

## User HSM

The U-HSM provides the following functionality:

-   Generated user keys
    -   User encryption keys
    -   User passcodes
    -   Base Keys \(for derivation of per-device encryption keys and passcodes, see [Per-Device Protocol](GUID-809EB1AF-697B-4466-8EE8-D38CDD3EBC10.md#)\)
-   Encrypt programming bitstreams
-   Generate data for security protocols \(see the [Libero SoC Design Flow User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/libero_ecf_ug.pdf)\)
-   Creation of Job Tickets
-   Creation of Programming Jobs
-   Validation of programming results \(see [Device Certificate of Conformance \(CoC\)](GUID-809EB1AF-697B-4466-8EE8-D38CDD3EBC10.md#)\)
-   Validation of programming job completion \(see [Job End Certifier Protocol](GUID-809EB1AF-697B-4466-8EE8-D38CDD3EBC10.md#)\)
-   Preparation of device manufacturing data for the M-HSM, such as DFK DB and manufacturing keys \(see the [User HSM Installation and Setup User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/user_hsm_ug.pdf)\)
-   Test Job Execution \(M-HSM function of U-HSM\)
    -   Complete functionality of the M-HSM
-   Support for all underlying cryptographic algorithms and generation of cryptographic-quality true random numbers needed above

## Manufacturer HSM

The M-HSM has software and firmware that is limited to job execution. The M-HSM is designed to be used by Production for the following:

-   Creation of Job Tickets with binding to the physical HSM module \(serving Job Requests\)
    -   Generation of protocol data \(see the [Libero SoC Design Flow User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/libero_ecf_ug.pdf)\)
-   Device authenticity check \(see [Device Authenticity Check Protocol](GUID-809EB1AF-697B-4466-8EE8-D38CDD3EBC10.md#)\)
-   Overbuild protection
-   Secured initial key loading
-   Providing job status
-   Providing proof of job completion
-   Collection of CoCs \(see [Device Certificate of Conformance \(CoC\)](GUID-809EB1AF-697B-4466-8EE8-D38CDD3EBC10.md#)\)
    -   Support for all underlying cryptographic algorithms and generation of cryptographic-quality true random numbers needed above
