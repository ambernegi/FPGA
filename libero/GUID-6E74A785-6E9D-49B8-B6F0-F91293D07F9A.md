# Edge\_Anchors for Memory Placement

The PolarFire silicon architecture requires that the Memory interface be<br /> placed in specific and pre-defined locations of the chip to achieve optimal QOR and timing<br /> performance. These specific location are called Edge\_Anchors and are used to identify the<br /> specific location in the PolarFire chip for optimal Memory Interface I/O placement. See the<br /> [PolarFire Family Memory Controller User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/PolarFire_FPGA_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_Memory_Controller_User_Guide_VB.pdf) for a mapping of DDR memory interface types to Edge\_Anchor locations. The<br /> Edge\_Anchors are as follows:

-   NORTH\_NE
-   NORTH\_NW
-   SOUTH\_SE
-   SOUTH\_SW
-   WEST\_NW
-   WEST\_SW

The ports for each Edge\_Anchor is represented by a different color for easy identification. The list of possible Edge\_Anchors is context-sensitive to the Memory Interface type and represents the legal and optimal locations for the specific Memory interface type. The list of Edge\_Anchors for DDR4, for example, is different from the list for DD2/DDR3. DDR4 has fewer locations \(Edge\_Anchors\) for I/O placement than DDR2/DD3.
