# Introduction

Libero® System-on-Chip \(SoC\) software provides a<br /> fully integrated Field Programmable Gate Array \(FPGA\) design<br /> environment. However, a few users might want to use third-party<br /> synthesis and simulation tools outside the Libero SoC<br /> environment. Libero can now be integrated into the FPGA design<br /> environment. It is recommended to use Libero SoC to manage the<br /> entire FPGA design flow.

This user guide describes the Custom Flow for PolarFire® and PolarFire<br /> SoC Family devices, a process to integrate Libero as a part of the larger FPGA design<br /> flow.

## Supported Device Families

The following table lists the device families that Libero SoC supports. However, some information in this guide might only apply to a specific family of devices. In this case, such information is clearly identified.

|Device Family|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|[PolarFire®](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas/polarfire-fpgas/polarfire-mid-range-fpgas)|PolarFire FPGAs deliver the<br /> industry’s lowest power at mid-range densities<br /> with exceptional security and reliability.|
|[PolarFire SoC](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/system-on-chip-fpgas/polarfire-soc-fpgas)|PolarFire SoC is the first SoC<br /> FPGA with a deterministic, coherent RISC-V CPU<br /> cluster, and a deterministic L2 memory subsystem<br /> enabling Linux® and real-time<br /> applications.|
