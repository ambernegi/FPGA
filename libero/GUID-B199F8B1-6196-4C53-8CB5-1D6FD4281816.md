# Logical Cone Persistency

A logical cone is created from any one of the three views and is associated with the view it is created from. A logical cone stay active as long as the netlist view it is created from is still open and active. Closing a netlist view also closes the logical cone view it is associated with. Opening a netlist view also brings back the cone view it is associated with. However, closing a cone view deletes the cone and it cannot be brought back into view. The cone has to be re-created.
