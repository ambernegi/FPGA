# Synthesis

Libero passes the block timing to the Synthesis tool when the top-level design is synthesized. This timing shell enables the synthesis tool to produce more accurate timing numbers for top-level synthesis.

The timing shell also instructs the synthesis tool to treat the design block as a black box. This is done automatically.

Use the Synthesis tool options \(**Design Flow &gt; Synthesize &gt; Configure Options**\) to resolve Place and Route conflicts.
