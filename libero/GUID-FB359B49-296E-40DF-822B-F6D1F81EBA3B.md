# Chip Planner Views

When the Chip Planner launches, it opens the following windows:

-   **Design View** window
-   **Floorplanner View** window
-   **Log** window
-   **Display Options** window
-   **Properties** window
-   **World View** window

All windows can be docked or undocked \(floating\), turned on or off,<br /> resized, or moved to the right, left, top, or bottom of the Chip Planner application.<br /> Docked windows can be stacked horizontally or vertically.

The **Design View** window provides the following<br /> view tabs for the design:

-   Port
-   Logical
-   Net
-   Region
-   Block \(only when the design instantiates a design block\)

The following table lists the icons in the toolbar. Hover the mouse on<br /> the icon shown in the **Floorplanner View** to see the tooltip.

## Design View Window and View Tabs

When Chip Planner opens, it presents a Design View window with five view<br /> tabs:

-   Port
-   Logical
-   Net
-   Region
-   Block - only if user blocks \(\*.cxz files\) exist in the design

Each of the view tabs displays a design view. A selection of a design<br /> element in one view is reflected in other views. For example, when you click and select<br /> a bus port in the Port View, the Logical View shows the OUTBUF/INBUF primitives \(for the<br /> bus\) selected and the Net View shows the net \(connected to the INBUF/OUTBUF of the port\)<br /> selected.

Similarly, when a user region is selected in the Region View, the<br /> selection is reflected in the Floorplanner View as well.

The Design View window can be docked and undocked.

## Find Window

Chip Planner provides a Find window for each of the five design views to<br /> search for design elements. You can also use the CTRL + F Hot Key. Multiple Find windows<br /> can be created for the same design view \(Port/Logical/Net/Region/Block\).

When the Find window opens, it is associated with a specific design view. Only design elements specific to the particular view are displayed. The view name \(Port/Logical/Net/Region/Block\) is displayed across the top of the window.

You can create multiple cloned Find windows for each view. Cloned Find<br /> windows are floating when they are opened and can be resized, moved, docked, or undocked<br /> \(floating\).

When the Find window is invoked in the Logical view, for example, the find window opens with the name Find \(Logical\) across the top of the window and the name Find \# \(Logical\) across the top of the window when there are multiple cloned Find windows for the same View.

By default, each cloned Find window is named sequentially as Find 1<br /> \(&lt;view\_name&gt;\), Find 2 \(&lt;view\_name&gt;\), Find 3 \(&lt;view\_name&gt;\), and so on. The<br /> cloned Find windows can be renamed to a name different from the default.

A cloned Find window has the same features and functionality as the main<br /> view window. In addition, a cloned Find window has an additional icon called Rename Tree,<br /> which renames the cloned Find window to a name other than the default name.

Multiple Find windows are useful in floorplanning. For example, if your<br /> design has both a RAM and a MACC block, and want to filter, select both, and display them<br /> in the Floorplanner View, you need two Find windows for the logical view: one with the<br /> filter based on Macro type &gt; RAM and the other with the filter based on Macro type &gt;<br /> MACC.

![](GUID-9C342A3E-BC72-4955-82A3-2A02276385D7-low.jpg "Find (Logical View)")

### Search and Filter

Search and Filter operations are available for the five views \(Port, Logical, Net, Region, and Block\).

1.  Open the Find windows and search for specific design elements.

2.  Click the **Filter** icon \(![](GUID-88A2191F-02F6-4845-996E-833EF3B8E0E8-low.png)\) in the Design View window or any cloned Find windows to search and filter the display. Three types of searches are available:-   Wildcard Filter—such as “\*” or “?” in the filter for wildcard matching. For example, when you type **FDDR\*** in the filter, the FDDR component and all its lower level primitives are displayed.
-   Use Regular Match Filter.
-   Regular Expressions—posix case insensitive regular expression search.
 **Note:** All filtering is case-insensitive.




## Port View

The Port View shows a hierarchical view of a design’s Input, Output, and<br /> Inout ports. Regular I/Os and Dedicated I/Os are displayed as follows:

-   Regular I/O ports—Input/Output/Inout ports that you can change or reassign. These appear under the **I/O Ports**tree.
-   Dedicated I/Os—Special-purpose I/Os that cannot be changed or reassigned by you. These are shown under **the Dedicated Ports** tree.

    ![](GUID-A9DE88BF-728F-465C-B60A-5AA5C3892083-low.jpg "Port View (Dedicated Ports)")


### Port Buses

Scalar members of a bus port are grouped under the bus. All bus ports can<br /> be collapsed or expanded as shown in the following figure.

![](GUID-33D0E564-7EAD-4B31-A473-17AFBBD94393-low.jpg "Bus Port DATA_OUT and Scalar Members")

### Port Properties

To see the properties of the port, select the port. The properties of the<br /> port you selected is displayed in the [Properties Window](GUID-FB359B49-296E-40DF-822B-F6D1F81EBA3B.md#). The selected<br /> port is also highlighted in the Floorplanner View and the World View.

### User Actions in Port View

In the Port View, you can:

-   Place ports to locations—Select a port, and then drag and drop it into the Floorplanner View at a valid resource location to assign the element to that location. All valid port locations are highlighted when you drag the selected element into the Floorplanner View.
-   Unplace ports from locations—Right click the port and choose **Unplace From Location**to unassign a port.
-   Lock Port to location—Right click the port and choose **Lock Placement**to lock selected port to the assigned location. This option is enabled only when the port is already placed in a location.
-   Unlock Port from location—Right click the port and choose **Unlock Placement**to unassign the port. This option is enabled only when the port is already locked to a location.
-   Region Assign—Right click a port and choose **Region Assign**. The Select Region dialog opens, and shows the regions available to assign that element. This dialog opens even if there are no User regions to which the selected item can be assigned. See the following figure.

![](GUID-D51CF3B8-5D07-4EDD-A1EF-68810A70D55F-low.jpg "Select Region Dialog Box")

-   Unassign Port from Region—Right click the port and choose **Unassign Macro to Region**to unassign a port macro from a region. This option is enabled only if the port is already assigned to a region.
-   Unassign All—Right click the port and choose **Unassign All**to unassign all the ports that are assigned to regions.
-   Unassign Selected Ports—Right click the port and choose **Unassign Selected Ports** to unassign all the selected ports that are assigned to regions.
-   Check DRC rules of selected interface—For a selected interface, DRC rules can be verified by selecting this option. A message in the Log window informs you whether the DRC rule check is successful.

### Port Sorting

Click the sort icon to sort the Ports by ascending or descending order,<br /> type, and port state:

![](GUID-6C57CF5C-12A4-4DF3-88D7-42362D0D60F6-low.jpg)

### Port Filtering

Either the traditional match filter or Regular Expression match filter is<br /> available. Enter a port name in the Filter text box to filter ports. Enable the **Use RegEx**check box to use Regular Expression match filtering.

#### Filter According to Port Types

The Port Filter list varies with the family and die.

#### Filter According to Port States

Port States filtering includes:

-   Placeable—All I/Os that you can place.
-   Unplaceable—All I/Os that you cannot place \(for example, dedicated I/O\).
-   Assigned to location—All I/Os that can be assigned to a location.
-   Not assigned to location—All I/Os that cannot be assigned to a location.
-   Assigned to region—All I/Os that can be assigned to a region.
-   Not assigned to region—All I/Os that cannot be assigned to a region.
-   Locked—All I/Os that are locked.
-   Unlocked—All I/Os that are not locked.

</table>## Logical View

The logical view is accessible from the Logical tab of the Design View window.

It displays a hierarchical view of all the logic inside the chip. The displayed Logic levels are:

-   Component—Displays the logic at the component level. This represents the hierarchy in the design.
-   Primitives—Displays the lowest level of the hierarchy \(hard macro level\). You can expand the hierarchy tree to see the lower level logic.

### **Logic Element Properties**

Click the component/primitive to find out the properties of the logic<br /> element you have selected. The properties of the component/primitive are displayed in the<br /> [Properties Window](GUID-FB359B49-296E-40DF-822B-F6D1F81EBA3B.md#). The selected design element is also highlighted in the Floorplanner View<br /> and in the World View.

### **User Action in Logical View**

Select a design element to:

-   Assign elements to locations—Right click a design element and choose **Place to Location**to assign the element to that location. All valid resource locations are highlighted in the Floorplanner View when you drag the selected element into the Floorplanner View. Only a single element can be assigned at a time.
-   Unassign element from location—Right click a design element and choose **Unplace from Location**. You can select multiple design elements/components and unassign them.
-   Lock element to location—Right click a design element and choose **Lock Placement**to lock the selected element to an assigned location. This option is enabled only when the element is already placed in a location. You can select multiple design elements/components and lock them.
-   Unlock element from location—Right click a design element and choose **Unlock Placement**to unlock or unfix a design element that is already locked to a location. This option is enabled when the element is already locked to a location. You can select multiple design elements/components and unlock them.
-   Region assign—Right click a design element and choose **Region Assign**. A new Select Region dialog box provides you different regions available to assign that element. This dialog box appears even if there are no User regions to which the selected item can be assigned. You can also drag and drop the selected elements directly into a region in the Floorplanner View. If the selected elements are not compatible or over-booked for the desired region, the selection is not assigned to the region and invalid elements are shown in red in the Properties window.
-   Unassign element from region—Right click a design element and choose **Unassign Macro from Region** to unassign a design element/macro from a region. This option is enabled only if the element is already assigned to a region. You can select multiple design elements/components and unassign them from a region.
-   Unassign all—Right click the port and choose **Unassign All**to unassign all the elements that are assigned to regions.
-   Unassign selected ports—Right click the port and choose **Unassign Selected Ports** to unassign all the selected elements that are assigned to regions.

### **Logical Filtering**

</table>#### Filter Criteria Based on Net Type

The net type and the filter list is family/die-specific. For the list of net filters<br /> specific to the family/technology of your project, see [Cross-Probing from SmartTime to Chip View or Netlist Viewer](GUID-4A2AD403-2B0D-4A10-9C55-0ECF5229D726.md#).

#### Filter Criteria Based on Routing Status

Options are:

-   Routed—Displays all routed nets.
-   Unrouted—Displays all unrouted nets.

### Global Nets

A global net is a net that uses global routing resources for routing a<br /> signal from source to destination logic clusters. These include Chip Globals<br /> Resources/Global Buffers \(GB\), Row global resources/row global buffers \(RGB\), and<br /> Half-Chip Globals \(HGB for RTG4\). Clocks, Async Reset, and nets with high fanout are<br /> typically routed through these global routing resources.

Global signals \(G\[n:0\]\) reach the logic clusters through row global signals<br /> \(RG\[7:0\]\) generated by an associated row global buffer \(RGB\). RGB are inferred by the<br /> layout tool. Depending on the placement of the design elements, it distributes the<br /> fanout of the global nets across multiple RGBs. The Net View shows this break-up for<br /> such global nets.

The following figure shows an example of Global Nets with different<br /> fanouts.

![](GUID-EA7A29CC-22A2-47D2-93E6-EDC0A4FB42E9-low.jpg "Global Nets Information with Different Fanouts Shown")

The following figure shows the Floorplanner View of the Global Net.
