# generate\_sdc\_constraint\_coverage

## Description

This Tcl command generates the constraint coverage report. The constraint coverage report<br /> contains information about the coverage of the paths from associated SDC constraints<br /> in the design. Two constraint coverage reports can be generated: one for Place and<br /> Route, and other for Timing Verification.

To run this command, there is no need to run Place-and-Route first, but the design must be in the post-synthesis state. The generated constraint coverage reports \(\*.xml\) are listed in the Reports tab and are physically located in the `<prj_folder>/designer/<module>/*constraints_coverage.xml` file.

**Note:** This command cannot be run until Compile has been run. Constraint Coverage Reports can be generated only after synthesis. A warning message appears, if the design is not in the post-synthesis state when this button is clicked.

```
generate_sdc_constraint_coverage -tool {PLACEROUTE | VERIFYTIMING}
```

## Arguments

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|tool|string|Specifies whether the constraint coverage report is based on the SDC constraint file associated with Place and Route or associated with Timing Verification. Use this dialog box to configure the ‘Verify Timing’ tool to generate a timing constraint coverage report and detailed static timing analysis and violation reports based on different combinations of process speed, operating voltage, and temperature. This is mandatory.|

## Error Codes

|Error Code|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|None|Required parameter 'tool' is missing.|
|None|Parameter 'param\_name' is not defined. Valid command formatting is 'generate\_sdc\_constraint\_coverage -tool "tool name"'.|
