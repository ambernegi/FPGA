# Interoperability Between Windows and Views

When a design object such as a net, an instance or a port is selected in<br /> the Design Tree window, the object is selected in the different netlist views. The reverse<br /> is also true. An object selected in one netlist view window is also selected in the Design<br /> Tree window and other netlist views.

Interoperability works only when the Toggle Cross-probing icon is<br /> enabled.
