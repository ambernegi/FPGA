# Synthesis Options to Resolve Place and Route Conflicts

If there are multiple blocks instantiated in the top-level design, users can use the synthesis options to resolve the conflicts. These options appear only if there are blocks in the design. Use the synthesis options \(**Design Flow** &gt; **Synthesize** &gt; **Configure Options**\) to resolve place and route conflicts.
