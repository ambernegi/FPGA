# Constraint Generation

When performing configuration and generation, make sure to write/generate the SDC/PDC/NDC constraint files for the design to pass them to Synthesis, Place-and-Route, and Verify Timing tools.

Use the Derive Constraints utility outside of the Libero environment to generate constraints instead of writing manually. To use the Derive Constraint utility outside of the Libero environment, you must:

-   Supply user HDL, component HDL and component SDC/NDC constraint files
-   Specify the top level module
-   Specify the location where to generate the derived constraint files

The SDC/NDC component constraints are available under `<project>/component/work/<component name>/<instance_name>/` directory after component configuration and generation.

**Important:**

-   If using RTG4FCCCECALIB core for RTG4 designs, you must supply the component NDC constraint file and specify the location to generate NDC constraints for your design.
-   Use CoreConfigP and CoreResetP for SmartFusion 2 MSS, you must specify the location to generate PDC constraints.

For more details on how to generate constraints for your design, see [Appendix Dâ€”Derive Constraints](GUID-C2F68D32-B5A8-46EF-B1F8-020E2627B30E.md).
