# Implementing Designs

The following topics describe how to implement the design.

**Note:**   Libero uses multiple cores automatically. For this reason, Libero does not provide options for setting multi-cores manually. The following scenarios describe when Libero uses multiple cores. Optimal runtime improvement is achieved when your system has at least four cores. Additional cores will deliver only marginal runtime improvements.

-   [Synthesis](GUID-16AC6815-2A39-4FFC-8AE9-F7A82337A198.md#) uses up to four cores when using Libero \(only one Synplify Pro license is needed for four cores\) if automatic or manual compile points are used.
-   [Place and Route](GUID-16AC6815-2A39-4FFC-8AE9-F7A82337A198.md#) uses up to four cores.
-   [Static timing analysis](GUID-16AC6815-2A39-4FFC-8AE9-F7A82337A198.md#) uses as many cores available.

## Synthesize

There are two ways to run synthesis using the Synthesis tool:

-   Run synthesis on your design with the default settings specified in the Synthesis tool: Double-click **Synthesize**.
-   Run the Synthesis tool interactively: Right-click **Synthesize** and choose **Open Interactively**. If you open the tool interactively, you must complete synthesis from within the Synthesis tool.

The default Synthesis tool included with Libero SoC is SynplifyPro ME. If you want to use a<br /> different Synthesis tool, change the settings in [Tool Profiles](GUID-DD5BFD75-BB76-49D8-99EA-EC328F43A5FD.md#).

You can organize input synthesis source files using the [Organize Source Files](GUID-DD5BFD75-BB76-49D8-99EA-EC328F43A5FD.md#) dialog box.

**Note:** Libero uses multiple cores automatically. For this reason, Libero does not provide options for setting multi-cores manually. The following scenarios describe when Libero uses multiple cores. For maximum runtime improvements, use four cores. Adding more cores delivers marginal improvements.

-   Synthesis uses up to four cores when using Libero \(only one Synplify Pro license is needed for four cores\).
-   Automatic or manual compile points.
-   Place and Route uses up to four cores.
-   Static timing analysis uses as many cores available.

### Synthesize Options

You can set or change synthesis configuration options using the Synthesize Options dialog<br /> box in the Synthesis tool.

To display this dialog box, expand **Implement Design** in the Design Flow<br /> window, right-click **Synthesize**, and choose **Configure Options**.

#### Active Implementation

The **Active Implementation** option allows you to select an active Synthesis<br /> or Identify implementation from a list of existing implementations. A check box is provided<br /> for creating a new Synthesis or Identify implementation. If you check this box, the options in<br /> the following table appear.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Synthesis Implementation|Click to specify the new implementation as a Synthesis Implementation.|
|Identify Implementation|Click to specify the new implementation as an Identify Implementation.|
|Implementation Name|Assign a name to the new Synthesis or Identify implementation.|

#### Global Nets \(Promotions and Demotions\)

Use the following options to specify the threshold value beyond which the Synthesis tool promotes<br /> the pins to globals:

**Note:** You cannot use these options to control hardwired connections to global resources, such as CCC hardwired connections to GB and I/O hardwired connections to GB.

Detect Clock Domain Crossings

</td><td>

Enable this option to detect all clock domain crossings \(CDC\) in the RTL design that have paths either between two asynchronous clocks or two synchronous clocks but with a false path or max-delay constraint. For each crossing, analyze if the RTL design contains a control or data synchronizer circuit and report if it is considered "safe" according to the minimum requirements you specify below. The option is checked by default.-   Minimum number of synchronizer registers. Range: 2–9. Default: 2


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The generated CDC report will not contain any synchronizer circuits formed with macros<br /> instantiated from the catalog. The generated report, with the name<br /> `<root_name>_cdc.csv`, will be visible in the respective<br /> Synthesis node of the report view \(**Design &gt; Reports**\). The<br /> report will contain all CDC inferred from the RTL design and explain the reason\(s\) why a<br /> synchronizer is considered unsafe.

### SynplifyPro ME

SynplifyPro ME is the default Synthesis tool for Libero SoC.

To run synthesis using SynplifyPro ME and its default settings, right-click **Synthesize** and choose **Run**.

For custom settings, use the following procedure to run Synplify interactively.

1.  If Synplify is your default Synthesis tool, right-click **Synthesize** in the Libero SoC Design Flow window and choose **Open Interactively**. Synplify starts and loads the appropriate design files with preset default values.
2.  From Synplify’s **Project** menu, choose **Implementation Options**.
3.  Set your specifications and click **OK**.
4.  Deactivate synthesis of the defparam statement. The defparam statement is only for simulation tools and is not intended for synthesis. Embed the defparam statement between the **translate\_on** and **translate\_off** synthesis directives:

    ```
    /* synthesis translate_off */
    defparam M0.MEMORYFILE = "meminit.dat"
    /*synthesis translate_on */
    // rest of the code for synthesis
    ```

5.  Click the **Run** button. Synplify compiles and synthesizes the design into an HDL netlist. The resulting `*.vm` files appear under **Synthesis Files** in the **Files** list.

    If errors appear after you click the **Run** button, use the Synplify editor to edit the file. Double-click the file name in the Synplify window showing the loaded design files. Your changes are saved to the original design file in your project.

6.  To close Synplify, from the **File** menu, choose **Exit**. When prompted to save changes you made, click **Yes**.

    **Note:** For a list of attributes related to Microchip devices, see the Microchip Attribute and Directive Summary in the Synplify online help.

    **Note:** To add a clock constraint in Synplify, add **n:&lt;net\_name&gt;** in your SDC file. If you omit the **n:**, the constraint will not be added.


### Identifying Debug Designs

Libero SoC integrates the Identify RTL debugger tool. Identify debugging software allows you to<br /> probe and debug your FPGA design directly in the source RTL. Use the software if the<br /> design behavior after programming is not in accordance with the simulation results.

The following list summarizes the Identify key features:

-   Instrument and debug your FPGA directly from RTL source code.
-   Internal design visibility at full speed.
-   Incremental iteration permit design changes made to the device from the Identify environment using incremental compile operations. This allows you to iterate in a fraction of the time it takes route the entire device.
-   Debug and display results allow you to collect only the data you need using unique and complex triggering mechanisms.

To open the Identify RTL debugger, in the Design Flow window, under **Debug Design**, double-click **Instrument Design**.

The following procedure describes how to use the Identify Instrumentor and Debugger. To run the<br /> following debugging flow, you must have the Identify RTL Debugger and the Identify<br /> Instrumentor.

1.  Create your source file and run pre-synthesis simulation.
2.  Optional: Perform an entire flow \(Synthesis - Compile - Place and Route - Generate a Programming File\) without starting Identify.
3.  Right-click **Synthesize** and choose **Open Interactively** in Libero SoC to launch Synplify.
4.  In Synplify, click **Options &gt; Configure Identify Launch** to setup Identify.
5.  In Synplify, create an Identify implementation by clicking **Project &gt; New Identify Implementation**.
6.  In the Implementations Options dialog box, make sure that the **Implementation Results &gt; Results Directory** points to a location under `<libero project>\synthesis\`; otherwise, Libero SoC will not detect your resulting Verilog Netlist file.
7.  From the Instrumentor UI, specify the sample clock, the breakpoints, and other signals to probe. Synplify creates a new synthesis implementation. Synthesize the design.
8.  In Libero SoC, run Synthesis, Place and Route and generate a programming file.

    **Note:** Libero SoC works from the edit netlist of the current active implementation, which is the implementation you created in Synplify for Identify debug.

9.  In the Design Flow window, double-click **Identify Debug Design** to launch the Identify Debugger.

To work properly, the Identify RTL Debugger, Synplify, and FlashPro must be synchronized. For<br /> more information about which versions of the tools work together, see the [Release Notes](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-later-versions#downloads).

## Verifying Post-Synthesized Designs

The following sections describe how to verify designs after they are synthesized.

### Generating Simulation Files

This step generates the post-synthesis Verilog or VHDL netlist for post-synthesis simulation.

-   The post-synthesis Verilog netlist file ends with a `*.v` extension.
-   The VHDL netlist file ends with a `*.vhd` extension.

Post-synthesis simulation verifies the post-synthesis<br /> implementation of the design.

The netlist file is in the synthesis folder of the project. Libero SoC passes this file to the<br /> simulator for the post-synthesis simulation run.

**Note:** Before performing post-synthesis, the design must pass the synthesis process. If you have not run synthesis, generating Simulation Files initiates a synthesis run automatically.

### Verifying Post-Synthesis Implementations - Simulate

The steps for performing [functional](GUID-BA52F539-E830-4341-B5FA-D07408FE99BC.md#) \(post-synthesis\) and timing \(post-layout\) simulation are nearly identical.

-   Perform functional simulation before Place and Route to simulate the functionality of the logic in the design.
-   Perform timing simulation after the design completes Place and Route. This simulation uses timing information based on the delays in the Place and Route designs.

To perform functional simulation:

1.  Back-annotate your design and create your testbench.
2.  In the Design Flow window, click **Implement Design**.
3.  Right-click **Simulate** and choose **Organize Input Files &gt; Organize Stimulus Files**.

    In the Organize Files for Source dialog box, all stimulus files in the current project appear in **Source Files** in the **Project** list box. Files associated with the block appear in the **Associated Source Files** list box.

    In most cases, you will have one testbench associated with your block. However, if you want simultaneous association of multiple testbench files for one simulation session, as in the case of PCI cores, add multiple files to the **Associated Source Files** list.

4.  To add a testbench, select the testbench you want to associate with the block in the **Source Files** in the **Project** list box and click **Add** to add it to the**Associated Source Files** list.
5.  To remove a testbench or change the files in the **Associated Source Files** list box, select the files and click **Remove**.
6.  To order testbenches, use the up and down arrows to define the order in which you want the testbenches compiled. The top level-entity must be at the bottom of the list.
7.  When you are satisfied with the **Associated Simulation Files** list, click **OK**.
8.  To start ModelSim ME Pro, right-click **Simulate** in the Design Hierarchy window and choose **Open Interactively**. ModelSim ME Pro starts and compiles the appropriate source files. When the compilation completes, the simulator runs for 1ps and the Wave window shows the simulation results.
9.  Scroll in the Wave window to verify the logic works as intended. Use the cursor and zoom buttons to zoom in, zoom out, and measure timing delays.
10. When you are done, click **Quit** from the **File** menu.

## Compile Netlist

Compile contains functions that perform legality checking and basic netlist optimization.<br /> Compile checks for netlist errors \(bad connections and fan-out problems\) removes unused<br /> logic \(gobbling\) and combines functions to reduce logic count and improve performance.<br /> Compile also verifies that your selected device has sufficient resources to fit the<br /> design.

The Compile Netlist step appears in the Design Flow window after unchecking the<br /> **Enable Synthesis** option in the **Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Design Flow** page. This option appears after<br /> importing or linking your HDL Netlist files into the project and building the design<br /> hierarchy.

To compile your device with default settings, right-click **Compile Netlist** in the Design Flow window and choose **Run**<br /> or double-click **Compile Netlist**.

To compile your design with custom settings, right-click **Compile Netlist** in the Design Flow window and choose **Configure Options**.

During compile, the Log window shows information about your design, including warnings<br /> and errors. Libero SoC issues warnings when your design violates recommended Microchip<br /> design rules. Microchip recommends that you address all warnings, if possible, by<br /> modifying your design before you continue.

If the design fails to compile due to errors, modify the design to remove the errors and<br /> re-Compile.

The Compile Netlist Options set the threshold value for global resource promotion and<br /> demotion when Place and Route is executed.

|Number of global resources|<br /> Number of available global resources for the die.<br />|
|Maximum Number of global nets that could be demoted to<br /> row-globals|<br /> Maximum number of global nets that can be demoted to row-globals. <br /> Default: 16<br />|
|Minimum fanout of global nets that could be demoted to row-globals|<br /> Minimum fanout of global nets that can be demoted to row-global. If<br /> you run out of global routing resources for your design, reduce this<br /> number to allow more globals to be demoted or select a larger die<br /> for your design.<br /> Default: 1000<br />|
|Minimum fanout of non-clock nets to be kept on globals|<br /> Minimum fanout of non-clock \(data\) nets to be kept on globals \(no<br /> demotion\). If you run out of global routing resources for your<br /> design, increase this number.<br /> Range: 1000–200000<br /> Default: 5000<br />|

## Configure Flash\*Freeze \(SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2\)

SmartFusion 2 SoC and IGLOO 2 FPGAs support Flash\*Freeze technology for<br /> implementing low-power solutions.

Flash\*Freeze mode is an ultra-low power static mode with the lowest<br /> standby power of 1.92 mW. It allows easy entry and exit from ultra-low power<br /> static mode while retaining SRAM content, I/O state, and register data,<br /> significantly reducing power.

For more information about Flash\*Freeze mode, see the [SmartFusion2 and IGLOO2 FPGA Low-Power Design User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/SoC/microsemi_smartfusion2_igloo2_fpga_low_power_design_user_guide_ug0444_v5.pdf) .

Fabric SRAMs — both the Large SRAM \(LSRAM\) instances of RAM1xK18 and the Micro SRAM \(μSRAM\)<br /> instances of RAM64x18 — can be placed into Suspend mode or Sleep<br /> mode. These SRAMs are grouped in rows in Libero SoC devices.

### uRAM/LSRAM State

The following table describes the uRAM/LSRAM State options.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Sleep|Selects Sleep mode. LSRAM and uSRAM contents are not<br /> retained.|
|Suspend|Selects Suspend mode. LSRAM and uSRAM contents are retained.|

### MSS Clock Source

The lower the frequency, the lower the power. However, some peripherals, such as SPI or<br /> MMUART, can remain active. In these cases, you might need a higher MSS clock frequency<br /> \(for example, to meet the baud rate for MMUART\).

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|On-Chip 1 MHz RC Oscillator|Uses the on-chip 1 MHz RC oscillator block.|
|On-Chip 50 MHz RC Oscillator|Uses the on-chip 50 MHz RC oscillator block.|

## Configure Register Lock Bits

For SmartFusion 2, IGLOO 2, and RTG4 devices, use the Register Lock Bits Configuration<br /> tool to lock MSS, SERDES, and FDDR configuration registers to prevent them from being<br /> overwritten by initiators that access these registers. The register lock bits are set in<br /> a text file \(`*.txt`\) and imported into a SmartFusion 2/IGLOO 2<br /> project.

1.  From the Design Flow window, click **Configure Register Lock Bits** to display the Register Lock Bits Setting dialog box.

    <br />

    ![???](GUID-4D2B7079-B664-4C72-AFF2-6A1D3DEA5F64-low.jpg)

    <br />

2.  Click the **Browse** button to navigate to a text \(`*.txt`\) file that contains the Register Lock Bit settings.

### Register Lock Bit Text File Template

An initial Configuration Lock Bit file can be generated from the Design Flow window by clicking<br /> **Generate FPGA Array Data**.

The initial \(default\) file is named<br /> `<proj_location>/designer/<root>/<root>_init_config_lock_bits.txt`.<br /> Edit this file to ensure that the lock bits are set to “0” for all register bits you<br /> want to lock. After editing the file, save it as a `*.txt` file with a<br /> different name, and then import the file into the project using the Register Lock Bit<br /> Settings dialog box \(**Design Flow window &gt; Configure Register Lock Bits**\).

### Register Lock Bit File Syntax

A valid entry in the Lock Bit Configuration file is defined as a &lt;lock\_parameters&gt; &lt; lock bit value&gt; pair.

-   If the lock bit is for a register, the parameter name is defined as: `<Physical block name>_<register name>_LOCK`
-   If the lock bit is for a field, the parameter name is defined as: `<Physical block name>_<register name>_<field name>_LOCK`

The physical block name can vary with device family and device \(see the following table\).

<table id="TABLE_AY3_WFC_34B"><thead><tr><th>

Family

</th><th>

Name

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

SmarftFusion 2 and IGLOO 2 devices

</td><td>

-   MSS
-   FDDR
-   SERDES\_IF\_x \(where x is 0, 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the physical SERDES location\) for SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2 010/025/050/150 devices.
-   SERDES\_IF2 060/090 devices \(only one SERDES block per device for SmartFusion 2 and IGLOO 2 devices\).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>Setting the lock bit value to ‘1’ indicates that the register can be written. Setting it to “0” indicates that the register cannot be written \(locked\). Lines starting with “\#” or “;” are comments. Empty lines are permitted in the Lock Bit Configuration file.

</table>### Constraints and Design Invalidation

A tool in the Design Flow changes from a PASS state \(green check mark\) to an OUT OF DATE state when a source file or setting affecting the outcome of that tool has changed.

The out-of-date design state is identified by the ![???](GUID-9F3A18CA-0442-4355-B9B3-005B74519CE4-low.jpg) icon in the Design Flow window. Sources and/or settings are defined as:

-   HDL sources \(for Synthesis\), gate level netlist \(for Compile\), and Smart Design components

-   Design Blocks \(`*.cxz` files\) – low-level design units that might have completed Place and Route and re-used as components in a higher level design
-   Constraint files associated with a tool
-   Upstream tools in the Design Flow:
    -   If the tool state of a Design Flow tool changes from PASS to OUT OF DATE, the tool states of all the tools below it in the Design Flow, if already run and are in PASS state, also change to OUT OF DATE with appropriate tooltips. For example, if the Synthesis tool state changes from PASS to OUT OF DATE, the tool states of Place and Route tool as well as all the tools below it in the Design Flow change to OUT OF DATE.
        -   If a Design Flow tool is CLEANED, the tool states of all the tools below it in the Design Flow, if already run, change from PASS to OUT OF DATE.
        -   If a Design Flow tool is rerun, the tool states of all the tools below it in the Design Flow, if already run, are CLEANED.
    -   Tool Options
        -   If the configuration options of a Design Flow tool \(right-click the tool and choose **Configure Options**\) are modified, the tool states of that tool and all the other tools below it in the Design Flow, if already run, are changed to OUT OF DATE with appropriate tooltips.
    -   Project Settings:
        -   Device selection
        -   Device settings
        -   Design Flow
        -   Analysis operating conditions

|Core voltage range \(V\)| |Verify Timing, Verify Power|OUT OF DATE|
|Default I/O voltage range| |<br /> Verify Timing, Verify Power<br />|OUT OF DATE|

**Note:** Cleaning a tool means the output files from that tool are deleted including log and report files, and the tool’s state is changed to NEW.

### Check Constraints

When a constraint file is checked, the Constraint Checker does the following:

-   Checks the syntax
-   Compares the design objects \(pins, cells, nets, ports\) in the constraint file versus the design objects in the netlist \(RTL or post-layout ADL netlist\). Any discrepancy \(For example, constraints on a design object which does not exist in the netlist\) are flagged as errors and reported in the \*\_sdc.log file.

### Design State and Constraints Check

Constraints can be checked only when the design is in the right state.

|Constraint Type|Check for Tools|Required Design State Before Checking|Netlist Used for Design Objects Checks|Check Result|
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
|<br /> I/O Constraints<br />|<br /> Place and Route<br />|<br /> Post-Synthesis<br />|<br /> ADL Netlist<br />|<br /> Reported in Libero Log Window<br />|

|<br /> Netlist Attributes<br />|<br /> NDC Check<br />|<br /> Pre-Synthesis<br />|<br /> RTL Netlist<br />|<br /> Reported in Libero Log Window<br />|

A pop-up message appears when the check is made, and the design flow has not reached the<br /> right state.

![](GUID-8845D3D5-6657-4A76-9FBD-E7BEC2226088-low.jpg "Pop-Up Message: Design State Insufficient for Constraints Check Operation")

### Edit Constraints

Click the **Edit with I/O Editor/Chip Planner/Constraint Editor**button to edit<br /> existing and add new constraints. Except for the Netlist Attribute constraints \(\*.fdc<br /> and \*.ndc\) file, which cannot be edited by an interactive tool, all other constraint<br /> types can be edited with an Interactive Tool. The \*.fdc and \*.ndc files can be edited<br /> using the Libero SoC Text Editor.

-   The I/O Editor is the interactive tool to edit I/O Attributes, Chip Planner is the interactive tool to edit Floorplanning Constraints, and the Constraint Editor is the interactive tool to edit Timing Constraints.
-   For Timing Constraints that can be associated to Synthesis, Place and Route, and Timing Verification, you need to specify which group of constraint files you want the Constraint Editor to read and edit:
    -   **Edit Synthesis Constraints**- reads associated Synthesis constraints to edit.
    -   **Edit Place and Route Constraints**- reads only the Place and Route associated constraints.
    -   **Edit Timing Verification Constraints**- reads only the Timing Verification associated constraints.

For the three SDC constraints files \(a.sdc, b.sdc, and c.sdc, each with Tool Association<br /> as shown in the following table\) when the Constraint Editor opens, it reads the SDC file<br /> based on your selection and the constraint file/tool association.

| |Synthesis|Place and Route|Timing Verification|
|---|---------|---------------|-------------------|
|a.sdc|—|X|X|
|b.sdc|X|X|—|
|c.sdc \[target\]|X|X|X|

-   **Edit Synthesis Constraints**reads only the b.sdc and c.sdc when Constraint Editor opens.
-   **Edit Place and Route Constraints**reads a.sdc, b.sdc, and c.sdc when Constraint Editor opens.
-   **Edit Timing Verification Constraints**reads a.sdc and c.sdc when Constraint Editor opens.

Constraints in the SDC constraint file that are read by the Constraint Editor and<br /> subsequently modified by you will be written back to the SDC file when you save the<br /> edits and close the Constraint Editor.

When you add a new SDC constraint in the Constraint Editor, the new constraint is added<br /> to the c.sdc file, because it is set as target. If no file is set as target, Libero SoC<br /> creates a new SDC file to store the new constraint.

### Constraint Type and Interactive Tool

## Place and Route

Double-click **Place and Route**to run Place and Route on your design with the default settings.

### Place and Route Options

To change your place and route settings from the Design Flow window, expand<br /> **Implement Design**, right-click **Place and Route**, and choose **Configure Options**. When the<br /> Layout Options dialog box appears, specify your settings, and then click<br /> **OK**.

![](GUID-322A2054-9950-47D1-AD53-519E1F06F20B-low.jpg "Layout Options Dialog Box")

![???](GUID-322A2054-9950-47D1-AD53-519E1F06F20B-low.jpg)

The following table describes the place and route options.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Timing-Driven|Timing-driven Place and Route strives to meet timing constraints<br /> specified by you or generated automatically. Timing-driven Place and<br /> Route delivers better performance than Standard Place and<br /> Route.If you do not select this option, Libero SoC ignores<br /> timing constraints, although timing reports based on timing<br /> constraints can still be generated for the design.|
|Power-Driven|This option is available when Timing-Driven is checked. This<br /> option runs the Power-Driven layout. This layout reduces dynamic<br /> power while still maintaining timing constraints.|
|I/O Register Combining|This option is available when Timing-Driven is checked. This<br /> option combines any register directly connected to an I/O when it<br /> has a timing Constraint. If multiple registers are directly<br /> connected to a bi-directional I/O, select one register to combine in<br /> the following order: input-data, output-data, output-enable.|
|Global Pins Demotion|This option is available when Timing-Driven is checked. This<br /> option allows the layout tool to select the most timing critical<br /> pins on any Global network and moves them to the source that drives<br /> the Global resource \(proactively attempts to improve timing by<br /> putting timing-critical pins onto routed resources\).If the driver<br /> for the global is a fabric register, the driver is replicated<br /> and the duplicate names are printed. Each set of names must be<br /> used in place of the original register in any specified timing<br /> constraint.|
|Driver Replication|This option is available when Timing-Driven is checked. This<br /> option allows an algorithm to replicate critical net drivers to<br /> reduce timing violations. The algorithm prints the list of registers<br /> along with the duplicate names. Each set of names must be used in<br /> place of the original register in any specified timing<br /> constraint.|
|High Effort Layout|This option is available when Timing-Driven is checked. This<br /> option improves layout success, but increases layout runtime and can<br /> impact timing performance.|
|Repair Minimum Delay Violations|This option is available when Timing-Driven is checked. This<br /> option repairs Minimum Delay violations \(Timing-Driven Place and<br /> Route option enabled\) and performs an additional route. This is done<br /> by increasing the length of routing paths and inserting routing<br /> buffers to add delay to the top violating paths.If this option is<br /> enabled, the programmable delays through I/Os are adjusted to<br /> meet hold time requirements from input to registers. For<br /> register-to-register paths, buffers are inserted.The<br /> Repair tool analyzes paths iteratively with negative minimum<br /> delay slacks \(hold time violations\) and chooses suitable<br /> connections and locations to insert buffers. Not all paths can<br /> be repaired using this technique, but many common cases will<br /> benefit.Even when this option is enabled, it will not<br /> repair a connection or path that:Is a<br /> hardwired, preserved, or global net.Has a<br /> sink pin, which is a clock pin.Violates<br /> a maximum delay constraint \(that is, the maximum delay<br /> slack for the pin is negative\).Can cause<br /> the maximum delay requirement for the sink pin to be<br /> violated \(setup violations\).Typically, this option is enabled with the<br /> Incremental Layout option when a design’s maximum delay<br /> requirements are satisfied.Every effort is made to avoid<br /> creating max-delay timing violations on worst case<br /> paths.Min Delay Repair generates a report in the<br /> implementation directory that lists all the paths that were<br /> considered.If your design continues to have internal hold<br /> time violations, rerun repair Minimum Delay Violations with<br /> Incremental Layout to analyze additional paths.|
|Incremental Layout|<br /> Uses previous placement data as the initial placement for the<br /> next run.<br /> To preserve portions of your design, use Compile Points, which<br /> are RTL partitions of the design that you define before<br /> synthesis. The Synthesis tool treats each Compile Point as a<br /> block that allows you to preserve its structure and timing<br /> characteristics. By executing Layout in Incremental Mode,<br /> locations of previously placed cells and the routing of<br /> previously routed nets is preserved. Compile Points makes it<br /> easy to mark portions of a design as black boxes, and let you<br /> divide the design effort between designers or teams. For more<br /> information, see the Synopsys FPGA Synthesis Pro ME User<br /> Guide.<br />|
|Use Multiple Pass|Runs multiple passes of Place and Route to achieve the best<br /> layout result. Click **Configure** to specify the<br /> criteria you want to use to determine the best layout<br /> result.|
|Block Creation|This option is available only when the Block Creation option is<br /> turned on \(**Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Design Flow &gt; Enable Block Creation**\). The value entered here<br /> limits the number of row-global resources available in every<br /> row-global region of the device. During Place and Route of the<br /> block, the tool will not exceed this capacity on any row-global<br /> region. The default value is the maximum number of row-globals. If<br /> you enter a value lower than the maximum capacity \(the default\), the<br /> layout of the block can integrate with the rest of the design if it<br /> consumes the remaining row-global capacity.|

## Multiple Pass Layout Configuration

Multiple Pass Layout attempts to improve layout quality by selecting results from a few number of<br /> Layout passes. This is done by running individual place and route multiple times with<br /> varying placement seeds and measuring the best results for the specified criteria.

When using Multiple Pass Layout, observe the following guidelines:

-   Multiple Pass Layout saves your design file with the pass that has the best layout results. If you want to preserve your existing design state, you must save your design file with a different name before proceeding. To do this, select **File &gt; Save As**.
-   The following reports for each pass are written to the working directory to assist you in later analysis: timing, maximum delay timing violations, minimum delay timing violations, and power.
    -   `<root_module_name>_timing_r<runNum>_s<seedIndex>.rpt`
    -   `<root_module_name>_timing_violations_r<runNum>_s<seedIndex>.rpt`
    -   `<root_module_name>_timing_violations_min_r<runNum>_s<seedIndex>.rpt`
    -   `<root_module_name>_power_r<runNum>_s<seedIndex>.rpt`
    -   `<root_module_name>_iteration_summary.rpt` provides additional details about the saved files.

To configure multiple pass options:

1.  When running Layout, select the UI control in the Layout Options dialog box.
2.  Click **Configure**. The Multi-Pass Configuration dialog box appears.

    ![](GUID-7FCB1C6F-0A75-457E-B602-66D5A2E08A3A-low.jpg "Multi-Pass Configuration Dialog Box")

</table>### Iteration Summary Report

The file `<root_module>_iteration_summary.rpt` records a summary of<br /> whether the multiple pass run was started through the GUI or the<br /> `extended_run_lib` Tcl script, with arguments for repeating each run.<br /> Each new run appears with its own header in the Iteration Summary Report along with the<br /> fields `RUN_NUMBER` and `INVOKED AS`, followed by a table<br /> containing Seed Index, corresponding Seed value, Comparison data, Report Analyzed, and<br /> Saved Design information.

![](GUID-DBE880FA-12DF-4220-A2E1-8F7C7BB62127-low.jpg "Iteration Summary Report")

## Post Layout Editing of I/O Signal Integrity and Delay Parameters

The **Edit Post Layout Design** tool in the Design Flow allows you to tune I/O signal integrity parameters and external timing without executing Place and Route again.

Input is provided using a PDC file. From the Libero user interface, double-click **Edit Post Layout Design** to open a file selection dialog box and select the<br /> input file. In the batch flow, you can issue the command `edit_post_layout_design <input.pdc>`.

The PDC file contains one or more invocations of two PDC commands:

-   `edit_io`
-   `edit_instance_delay`

For more information about these commands, see the [PDC Commands User Guide for PolarFire FPGA](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/pf_pdc_ug.pdf).

To assist you in knowing those instances on which this tool can update delays, the<br /> Place-and-Route tool generates a `<root>_delayinstance.rpt` report<br /> file. This report has an editable \(**Editable?**\) column with<br /> **Yes** and **No** values that indicate<br /> whether a delay parameter can be edited by this tool.

The batch command `edit_post_layout_design` fails when any commands in the input PDC file fail. The PDC commands fail if the syntax is incorrect, the referenced instances do not exist, or the values are out of legal ranges. If the batch command fails, the layout state of the design does not change. If the batch command succeeds:

-   Layout state changes to reflect the values in the PDC commands.

-   Pin report and delay instance report files are regenerated to reflect the latest values.

-   Downstream tools Verify Timing, Verify Power, Generate FPGA Array Data, and Generate Back Annotated Files are invalidated.


The batch command `edit_post_layout_design` generates the log file<br /> `<project>/designer/<root>/top_editpostlayout_log.log` to<br /> provide information about the run and which PDC file was used in the run. This log gets<br /> appended with information from each run of the command. Each run’s start message is<br /> prefixed by the time when the run is executed. The log file can be viewed from the<br /> Reports tab \(Design &gt; Reports\). The log file is removed when Place and Route is run<br /> or cleaned.

In the following figure, downstream steps this tool invalidates are highlighted in<br /> yellow.

## Resource Usage

After completing the layout of your design, you can assess the resource usage to understand how efficiently your design utilizes the available resources on the chip. The **Resource Usage** report provides an overview of the types and percentages of resources used relative to the total resources available on the chip in a tabular format.

To access the report:

Type
:   Specifies the category of the resource being reported. It includes the following:

    4LUT
    :   4-input Look-up Table for executing any logic function involving up to four inputs. In the report, the number of 4-input lookup tables \(4LUTs\) indicates how many are used in the design, regardless of whether they are combined with D Flip-Flops \(DFFs\).

    DFF
    :   D Flip-Flop stores individual bits of data. The report shows the total number of DFFs used in the design, irrespective of their combination with 4LUTs.

    Logic Element
    :   A logic element \(LE\) is a unit in the fabric that might contain a 4LUT, a DFF, or both. The report includes all LEs, whether they contain only 4LUTs, only DFFs, or both.

    I/Os using I/O Registers
    :   Refers to the input/output resources that utilize I/O registers. These registers manage data flow between the internal logic and the external environment.

    I/O Register Flip-Flops
    :   Flip-flops specifically used in I/O operations. They are part of the I/O registers and help in managing the data flow for I/O operations.

    :   Input I/O Flip-Flops
:   Flip-flops are used for input operations such as capturing data from external sources.

        Output I/O Flip-Flops
        :   Flip-flops are used for output operations such as driving data to external destinations.

        Enable I/O Flip-Flops
        :   Flip-flops enable or disable I/O operations. They control the activation of input/output operations, providing fine-tuned management of data flow to and from the chip.

Used
:   Indicates the number of resources of each type that are currently utilized in the design. It provides a direct count of how many 4LUTs, DFFs, LEs, or I/O resources are used.

Total
:   Shows the total number of each resource type available on the chip. It represents the maximum capacity of the selected device for each resource type highlighting the limits within which your design must fit.

Percentage
:   Calculates the percentage of each resource type that is used relative to the total available resources. It is computed as \(Used/Total\) × 100.

### Overlapping of Resource Reporting

The [Resource Usage](GUID-16AC6815-2A39-4FFC-8AE9-F7A82337A198.md#) report contains the total number of used 4LUTs and DFFs, regardless of<br /> whether they are combined within LEs. The **Overlapping of Resource Reporting** provides detailed breakdown of LEs' utilization.

#### General Formulas for Logic Element Utilization

This section provides a set of general formulas that can be applied to calculate the<br /> usage of LEs in any design. Use these formulas to analyze how different components,<br /> such as 4LUTs and DFFs, are distributed across the available LEs.

Total LEs Used
:   Total LEs Used = LEs using both 4LUTs and DFFs + LEs using 4LUTs only or DFFs only

LEs Using 4LUT Only
:   LEs Using 4LUT Only = Total LEs used – LEs containing DFFs

    This formula calculates the number of LEs<br /> that contain only 4LUTs, excluding the LEs that also contain<br /> DFFs.

LEs Using DFF Only
:   LEs Using DFF Only = Total LEs used – LEs containing 4LUTs

    This formula calculates the number of LEs<br /> that contain only DFFs, excluding the LEs that also contain<br /> 4LUTs.

LEs Using Both 4LUT and DFF
:   LEs Using Both 4LUTs and DFFs = \(LEs containing 4LUTs + LEs containing DFFs\) – Total LEs used

LEs Using 4LUTs Only or DFFs Only
:   LEs Using 4LUTs only and DFFs only = LEs using DFFs only + LEs using 4LUTs only

These formulas are applied to different reports to calculate the usage of 4LUTs and<br /> DFFs resources within Logic Elements.

#### Example Application of Logic Element Utilization

To illustrate the practical use of the general formulas for Logic Element<br /> utilization, this section presents a detailed example.

**Important:** Numbers for 4LUTs, DFFs and LEs in **Overlapping of Resource Reporting** are generated as an example to demonstrate the calculations only.

The following example report provides a breakdown of how many of each type of<br /> resource is used in the design:

Used
:   4LUT = 400

    400 out of the 473 LEs have 4LUTs inside which is the total number of<br /> 4LUTs used in the design, irrespective of whether they are combined<br /> with DFFs. This means 73 \(473 - 400\) of them have no 4LUTS.

:   DFF = 300

    300 out of the 473 LEs have DFFs inside which is the total number of<br /> DFFs used, regardless of their combination with 4LUTs. This means<br /> 173 \(473 - 300\) of them have no DFFs.

:   Logic Elements = 473

    It details the number of LEs used, whether they contain only 4LUTs,<br /> only DFFs, or both.

<br />

The following table summarizes the calculations for this example:

|Logic Element Description|Calculated Logic Elements|
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|LEs using DFF only|<br /> Calculated as the used LEs minus those containing 4LUTs:<br /> 473 - 400 = 73<br /> <br />|
|LEs using 4LUTS only|<br /> Calculated as the used LEs minus those containing DFFs:<br /> 473 - 300 = 173<br />|
|LEs using 4LUTs only or DFFs only|<br /> Calculated as the sum of LEs using only one type of<br /> resource:<br /> 73 + 173 = 246<br />|
|LEs using both 4LUTs and DFFs|<br /> The overlap between LEs containing 4LUTs and DFFs, calculated<br /> as the sum of used 4LUT and used DFF minus the total used<br /> LEs:<br /> \(400 + 300\) – 473 = 227<br />|
|Total LEs used|The total number of Logic Elements<br /> used:**`473`**|

In the following figure, the overlapping area in a Venn diagram represents the LEs<br /> that utilize both 4LUTs and DFFs within the design.

## Global Net Report

The Global Net Report displays all the nets that use the global routing resources of the<br /> device. This report is generated after the Place and Route step and is available in XML<br /> format in the **Reports** tab \(**Libero SoC &gt; Design&gt;Reports &gt; &lt;design\_name&gt;\_glb\_net\_report.xml**\).

The global routing resources in Microchip FPGA devices offer a low-skew network for<br /> effective distribution of high fanout nets including clock signals. Global routing<br /> resources include the following:

-   Fabric CCC
-   Global Buffers \(GB\)
-   Row Global Buffers \(RGB\)

    ![](GUID-8188375F-ECDA-4831-A7B1-A17297FA4537-low.jpg "Global Net Report")


The following topics describe the sections in the Global Net Report.

### Global Nets Information

Under **Global Nets Information**, the **GB Location** column refers to the location of the global routing<br /> resource/instance name of the macro on the chip. The location is indicated by X-Y<br /> coordinates of the global resource macro.

![](GUID-F06AD640-5F19-4A99-89B5-3E4BDFF85F3E-low.jpg "Global Nets Information Section")

</table>### Fabric to GB Connections

The **Fabric to GB Connections** section lists all the nets originating from<br /> the fabric to the Global Resources/Instance name of the macro. The **From Location** column refers to the X-Y coordinates of the driver pin of the<br /> net. The nets are routed nets, not hardwired.

### CCC to GB Connections

The **CCC to GB Connections** section lists the nets originating from the<br /> Clock Conditioning Circuitry \(CCC\) outputs \(GLx\) to the Global Resources/instance name<br /> of the macro. To minimize clock skew, CCC clock outputs usually are hardwired dedicated<br /> connections to Global resources \(GB\).

### CCC Input Connections

The **CCC Input Connections** section lists the nets from the I/O pins<br /> to the CCC inputs.

Net type can be routed or hardwired. Hardwired net types are dedicated wiring resources<br /> and have lower insertion delays. Routed net types are implemented using fabric routing<br /> resources and the insertion delay \(generally higher than that of hardwired nets\), varies<br /> from iteration to iteration.

|To \(Pin Swapped for Back Annotation Only\)|For hardwired connections, input pin of the CCC in the back annotated<br /> netlist.|

### Local Clock Nets to RGB Connections

The **Local Clock Nets to RGB Connections** section lists the clock nets from<br /> the local clock nets to RGB \(Row globals\). RGBs are situated on the vertical stripes of<br /> the global network architecture inside the FPGA fabric. The global signals from the GBs<br /> are routed to the RGBs. Each RGB is independent and can be driven by fabric routing in<br /> addition to being driven by GBs. This facilitates using RGBs to drive regional clocks<br /> spanning a small fabric area, such as the clock network for SERDES.

### Warnings \(RTG4 only\)

The Warning section is available in RTG4 devices only. It gives warnings about clock or reset<br /> nets which are not radiation protected and recommends ways to protect the nets from<br /> radiation. Some warning examples are:

-   Clocks or reset nets that are routed are not radiation protected.
-   Hardwired connections from `DDRIO` bank are not radiation protected.
-   For radiation protection, Microchip recommends using dedicated global clocks that come with built-in radiation protection.

    ![](GUID-B639A8BC-17C4-4C0D-B9D0-563D44E46393-low.png "Warning Example 1")

-   Local resets that are not driven by three separate logic cones are not radiation protected.

    ![](GUID-C35F0D8E-0266-4148-AD56-86083F7B770C-low.png "Warning Example 2")

-   For radiation protection, Microchip recommends that each of the three inputs of every `RGRESET` be driven by three separate logic cones replicating the paths from the source registers. See the descriptions of `RGRESET` macro in the [Macro Library User Guide for RTG4](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/rtg4_mlg.pdf).

## Verify Post Layout Implementation

The following sections describe how to verify post-implementations of your design.

### Generate Back Annotated Files

The first step when verifying the post-layout implementation generates two files:

-   `*ba.sdf`
-   `*ba.v`/`.vhd`

The `*ba.sdf` file is a delay file in Standard Delay Format \(SDF\).<br /> It is used for back annotation to the simulator.

The `*ba.v`/`.vhd` file is a post-layout flattened netlist<br /> used for back-annotated timing simulation. The file can contain low-level macros to<br /> improve design performance.

This step allows you to select **Export Enhanced min delays for best case**.<br /> Checking this option exports your enhanced minimum delays to include the best-case<br /> timing results in your back annotated file.

### Simulate - Opens ModelSim ME Pro

The back-annotation functions are used to extract timing delays from your post layout data. These extracted delays are placed into a file for use by your CAE package’s timing simulator. The default simulator for Libero SoC is ModelSim ME Pro. You can change your default simulator in your [Tool Profile](GUID-DD5BFD75-BB76-49D8-99EA-EC328F43A5FD.md#).

To perform pre-layout simulation, in the Design Flow window, under **Verify Pre-Synthesized design**, double-click **Simulate**.

To perform timing simulation:

1.  Back-annotate your design and create your testbench.
2.  Right-click **Simulate** in the Design Flow window \(**Implement Design &gt; Verify Post-Synthesis Implementation &gt; Simulate**\) and choose **Organize Input Files &gt; Organize Simulation Files**.
    -   In the Organize Files for Source dialog box, all the stimulus files in the current project appear in the Source Files in the Project list box. Files already associated with the block appear in the **Associated Source Files** list box.

    -   In most cases, you will have one testbench associated with your block. However, if you want simultaneous association of multiple testbench files for one simulation session, as in the case of PCI cores, add multiple files to the **Associated Source Files** list.

    -   To add a testbench, select the testbench you want to associate with the block in the **Source Files** in the **Project** list box and click **Add**to add it to the Associated Source Files list.

    -   To remove or change the files in the **Associated Source Files** list box, select the files and click **Remove**.

    -   To arrange testbenches, use the up and down arrows to define the order you want the testbenches compiled. The top-level entity must be at the bottom of the list.

3.  When you are satisfied with the **Associated Simulation Files** list, click **OK**.
4.  To start ModelSim ME Pro, right-click **Simulate** in the Design Hierarchy window and choose **Open Interactively**. ModelSim ME Pro starts and compiles the appropriate source files. When the compilation completes, the simulator runs for 1 microsecond and the Wave window opens to display the simulation results.
5.  In the Wave window, scroll to verify the logic works as intended. Use the cursor and zoom buttons to zoom in and out and measure timing delays. If you did not create a testbench with WaveFormer Pro, you might receive error messages with the `vsim` command if the instance names of your testbench do not follow the same conventions as WaveFormer Pro. Ignore the error message and type the correct `vsim` command.
6.  On completion, from the **File** menu, click **Quit**.

### Verify Timing

Using the Verify Timing Configuration dialog box, you can configure the Verify Timing tool to<br /> generate a timing constraint coverage report along with detailed static timing analysis<br /> and violation reports based on different combinations of process speed, operating<br /> voltage, and temperature. For multi-corner analysis, the following operation<br /> conditioning corners are considered:

-   Max analysis at BEST and WORST operating conditions
-   Min analysis at BEST and WORST operating conditions

Although the analysis is done for all corners, Multi Corner Timing Analysis reports<br /> show only two conditions. To cross-check this, run the command with the tool.



The following figures show an example of the Verify Timing Configuration dialog box.

### SmartTime

SmartTime is the Libero SoC gate-level static timing analysis tool. With SmartTime, you can<br /> perform complete timing analysis of your design to ensure that you meet all timing<br /> constraints and that your design operates at the desired speed, with the right amount of<br /> margin across all operating conditions.

For information about creating and editing timing constraints, see the [Timing Constraints Editor User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/smarttime_ce_ug.pdf).

#### Static Timing Analysis \(STA\)

Static timing analysis \(STA\) identifies timing violations in your design and ensures it meets<br /> your timing requirements. You can communicate timing requirements and timing exceptions<br /> to the system by setting timing constraints. A static timing analysis tool then checks<br /> and reports setup and hold violations as well as violations on specific path<br /> requirements.

STA is well-suited for traditional synchronous designs. The main advantage of STA is that, unlike<br /> dynamic simulation, it does not require input vectors. It covers all possible paths in<br /> the design and does all the above with relatively low run-time requirements.

STA tools report all possible paths, including false paths. False paths are timing paths in the<br /> design that do not propagate a signal. Because STA tools do not automatically detect<br /> false paths in their algorithms, you need to identify false paths as false path<br /> constraints to the STA tool and exclude them from timing considerations to obtain a true<br /> and useful timing analysis.

##### Timing Constraints

SmartTime supports a range of timing constraints to provide useful analysis and efficient timing-driven layout.

##### Timing Analysis

SmartTime provides analysis types that allow you to:

-   Find the minimum clock period/highest frequency that does not result in a timing violations
-   Identify paths with timing violations
-   Analyze delays of paths that have no timing constraints
-   Perform inter-clock domain timing verification
-   Perform maximum and minimum delay analysis for setup and hold checks

To improve the accuracy of the results, SmartTime evaluates clock skew during timing analysis by<br /> computing individual clock insertion delays for each register.

SmartTime checks the timing requirements for violations, such as multicycle or false paths, while<br /> evaluating timing exceptions.

#### SmartTime and Place and Route

Timing constraints impact analysis the same way they affect place and route. As a result, adding<br /> and editing timing constraints in SmartTime is the best way to achieve optimum<br /> performance.

#### SmartTime and Timing Reports

The following report files can be generated from **SmartTime &gt; Tools &gt; Reports**:

-   Timing Report \(for both Max and Min Delay Analysis\)
-   Timing Violations Report \(for both Max and Min Delay Analysis\)
-   Bottleneck Report
-   Constraints Coverage Report
-   Combinational Loop Report

#### SmartTime and Cross-Probing into Chip Planner

From SmartTime, you can select a design object and cross-probe the same design object in Chip Planner. Design objects that can be cross-probed from SmartTime to Chip Planner include:

-   Ports
-   Macros
-   Timing Paths

For more information, see the **SmartTime User’s Guide** \(**Libero SoC &gt; Help &gt; Reference Manual &gt; SmartTime User’s Guide**\).

#### SmartTime and Cross-Probing into Constraint Editor

From SmartTime, you can cross-probe into the Constraint Editor. Select a Timing Path in<br /> SmartTime’s Analysis View and add one of the following Timing<br /> Exception Constraints:

-   False Path
-   Multicycle Path
-   Max Delay
-   Min Delay

The Constraint Editor reflects the newly added timing exception<br /> constraint.

### SmartPower

SmartPower is the Microchip SoC state-of-the-art power analysis tool. SmartPower allows you to visualize power consumption and potential power consumption problems within your design globally and in-depth, so you can adjust to reduce power consumption.

SmartPower provides a detailed and accurate way to analyze designs for Microchip SoC FPGAs. From a top-level summary, you can analyze specific functions within the design, such as gates, nets, I/Os, memories, clock domains, blocks, and power supply rails.

You can analyze the hierarchy of block instances and specific instances within a hierarchy. Each analysis can be viewed in different ways to show the respective power consumption of the component pieces.

SmartPower allows you to analyze power by functional modes, such as Active, Flash\*Freeze, Shutdown, Sleep, or Static, depending on the specific FPGA family used. You can also create custom modes created in the design. Custom modes can also be used for testing "what if" potential operating modes.

SmartPower allows you to create test scenario profiles. Using a profile, you can create sets of operational modes to understand the average power consumed by a combination of functional modes, such as a combination of Active, Sleep, and Flash\*Freeze modes used over time in an application.

SmartPower generates detailed hierarchical reports of the power consumption of a design for easy evaluation. This allows you to find power consumption sources and take appropriate action to reduce power.

SmartPower supports the Value-Change Dump \(VCD\) file format, as specified in the IEEE® 1364 standard, generated by the simulation runs. Support for this format allows<br /> you to generate switching activity information from ModelSim ME Pro or other simulators, and<br /> then use the switching activity-over-time results to evaluate average and peak power<br /> consumption for your design.

For more information, see the [SmartPower User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/smartpower_ug.pdf).

### Simultaneous Switching Noise

Simultaneous Switching Noise \(SSN\) is the Libero SoC voltage noise analysis tool. It provides a<br /> detailed analysis of the noise margin about each I/O pin in the design, based on the pin<br /> information and other active pins placed in the same I/O bank of the design. The tool<br /> computes the noise margin based on I/O standards, drive strength, and pin placement. The<br /> SSN Analyzer helps you achieve the desired voltage noise margin, resulting in improved<br /> signal integrity.

To open the SSN Analyzer, right-click **SSN Analyzer** in the Design Flow<br /> window and select **Open Interactively**.

#### SSN Noise Analyzer Reports Failure Procedure

If the SSN Noise Analyzer reports poor noise margin or failure, perform the following<br /> procedure to improve the noise margin:

1.  Change the I/O standard to one that has a lower noise impact for the failing I/O Bank.
2.  Select the lower Drive-Strength to reduce the noise. Open the I/O Advisor to see the power/timing impact of the specific I/O cell.
3.  Rerun the SSN Analyzer to see if the noise margin of the I/O Cell improves. In this scenario, Place and Route information remains intact.
4.  If the improvement is not significant, open the Pin Attributes Editor and change the placement of the pin within the I/O bank to a location farther away from the noisy pins.
5.  Spread the failing pins across multiple I/O banks. This reduces the number of aggressive outputs on the power system of the I/O bank.
6.  Rerun Place-and-Route and rerun SSN Analyzer to check the Noise Report.
