# Schmitt Trigger

GPIO and HSIO can be configured as a Schmitt Trigger input. When<br /> configured as ON, it exhibits a hysteresis that helps to filter out the noise at the<br /> receiver and prevents double-glitching caused by noisy input edges. Default configuration<br /> is OFF \(Schmitt Trigger disabled\).
