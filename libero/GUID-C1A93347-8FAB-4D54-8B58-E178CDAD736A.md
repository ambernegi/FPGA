    The dialog box has two sections: **Units**and **Use Toggle Rates**.

    -   **Units**: sets unit preferences for power \(W, mW, and uW\) and frequency \(Hz, KHz, and MHz\).
    -   **Use toggle rates**: when checked, the data frequency of all the clock domains is defined as a function of the clock frequency. This updates the data frequency automatically when you update the clock frequency. Toggle rates allow you to specify the data frequency as a percentage of clock frequency, but you can no longer specify the data frequency as a number, only as a percentage of the clock frequency. To specify data frequencies, clear the **Use toggle rates**option in the Preferences window.
    You can set the data frequency percentage when you create a new clock domain<br /> with toggle rates active. In addition, when toggle rates are active you can<br /> set the data frequency percentage in the **Domain and Frequencies**<br /> tabs.
