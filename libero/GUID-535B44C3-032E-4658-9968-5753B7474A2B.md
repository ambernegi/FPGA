# Interface—Specific I/Os and Views

The PolarFire architecture is designed and optimized to support Memory<br /> interface, IOD interface, and Transceiver interface. The I/O Editor for PolarFire provides<br /> three special views specifically for I/O assignments of these interfaces.

For optimal Quality of Result \(QOR\) and timing performance, the<br /> architecture of the PolarFire silicon requires the Memory Interface, IOD Interface and<br /> Transceiver Interface be placed in specific and pre-defined locations of the chip.<br /> Assignment of these interfaces are checked against PolarFire DRC rules and illegal<br /> assignments are flagged.

The I/O Editor is a Graphical User Interface \(GUI\) tool designed to make<br /> Interface I/O pin assignments graphically and user-friendly, as an alternative to writing<br /> PDC commands. When the pin assignment is committed and saved in I/O Editor, a PDC file is<br /> created. This PDC file can then be passed to the Place and Route tool as a Physical Design<br /> Constraint.
