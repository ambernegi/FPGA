# Using the MSVT Tool

The MSVT tool prints a comprehensive report about each block and corresponding IRS region being verified. If any block or IRS signals do not satisfy the minimum separation criteria, the tool reports the details of the affected instances. More information about each section of the report is described in the following sections.

An MSVT failure indicates that the design has not met the design separation criteria and that one or more sub-blocks \(or signals\) are not independent from the rest of the system. In this case, you must:

-   Identify the instances that cause violations in the MSVT output and modify the design floor-plan accordingly.
-   Recompile the design to generate a new placed and routed netlist.
-   Use the MSVT tool to verify the modified design.
