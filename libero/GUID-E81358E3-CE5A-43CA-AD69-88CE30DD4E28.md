# Introduction

The Microchip Libero® System-on-Chip \(SoC\) design suite offers high<br /> productivity with its comprehensive, easy-to-learn, easy-to-adopt development tools for<br /> designing with Microchip’s power efficient Flash [Field-Programmable Gate Arrays \(FPGAs\)](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas), [SoC FPGAs](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/system-on-chip-fpgas/smartfusion-fpgas), and [Rad-Tolerant FPGAs](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/radiation-tolerant-fpgas). The suite integrates industry-standard<br /> Synopsys [SynplifyPro®](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/synthesis-and-simulation/synplify-pro-me) synthesis and Siemens EDA<br /> QuestaSim® simulation with best-in-class constraints<br /> management, debug capabilities, and secure production programming support.

## Supported Device Family

The following table lists the family of devices that Libero SoC supports. This guide covers all these device families. However, some information in this guide might apply to certain device families only. In this case, such information is clearly identified.
