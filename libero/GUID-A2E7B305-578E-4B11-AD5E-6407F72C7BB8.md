# User I/O Lock Down

If checked, the pin is controlled by the Tamper macro IO\_Disable signal.<br /> When Tamper IO\_Disable is asserted, the selected I/O pin is disabled. Inputs are disabled<br /> and detected as a logic low by FPGA fabric. Outputs are tri-state with any configured<br /> pull-up or pull-down still honored.

**Note:** This is applicable for PolarFire and PolarFire SoC families only.
