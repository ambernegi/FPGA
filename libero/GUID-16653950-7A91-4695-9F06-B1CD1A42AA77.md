# Chain Programming

This section describes how to perform chain programming.

## Chain Order

Chain Programming allows you to program several devices at one time. The order of devices<br /> in the chain imported from Job Project must match the physical chain to be<br /> programmed.

The TDO for the first device connects to the programmer, and the last device's TDI<br /> connects to the programmer. The devices in the chain go in order from a device's TDI<br /> into the next device's TDO, as shown in the following figure.

## Multiple Device Chain Programming

The FlashPro Express software allows direct chain programming without generating a chain STAPL<br /> file. Each device is programmed in sequential order, starting from device 1 to device<br /> *N* \(see the following example\).

`TDI > Device N > Device N-1 >â€¦ > Device 2 > Device 1 > TDO`

### Device Programming Compatibility

PolarFire, SmartFusion 2, IGLOO 2, and RTG4 devices can be programmed in the same chain.

### Programmer Support

FlashPro5/4/3/3X supports PolarFire, SmartFusion 2, IGLOO 2, and RTG4 devices. The Vpump on<br /> FlashPro5/4/3/3X is designed to support the programming of only one device. Make sure<br /> that Vpump, Vcc, and Vjtag are provided on board for chain programming. Connect the<br /> Vpump to the header as the Flashpro Express software will attempt to check for all<br /> external supplies, including Vpump, to ensure successful programming. There is no<br /> limitation to the chain length; however, ensure that the JTAG signal integrity and the<br /> timing are preserved.
