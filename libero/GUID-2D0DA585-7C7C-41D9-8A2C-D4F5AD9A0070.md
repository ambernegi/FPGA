# Block PDC Commands

`move_block` and `set_block_options` are two PDC commands available for working with design blocks at the top-level design.

Use the `move_block` and `set_block_options` commands to make changes in the top-level design.

In the top-level design, put the `move_block` and `set_block_options` commands in an NDC file \(**Design Flow Window** &gt; **Manage Constraints** &gt; **Open Manage Constraints View** &gt; **Netlist Attributes** &gt; **New** &gt; **Create New Compile Netlist Constraints NDC**\) and associate the NDC file with Synthesis.
