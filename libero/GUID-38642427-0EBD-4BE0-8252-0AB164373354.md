# PDC Physical Design Constraints

In the Libero IP core reference project, this top-level PDC constraint file is available<br /> from the Constraint Manager \(`Design Flow > Open Manage Constraint View >Timing > Derive Constraints`\).

**Important:** See this file to set the PDC constraints for the CoreConfigP component. Modify the full hierarchical path, if necessary, to match your design hierarchy or use the Derive\_Constraints utility and steps in [Appendix D—Derive Constraints](GUID-C2F68D32-B5A8-46EF-B1F8-020E2627B30E.md) on the component level PDC file. Save the `*.pdc` file to a different name. Import the PDC file to your project and use it for Compile, just like any other PDC constraint files.
