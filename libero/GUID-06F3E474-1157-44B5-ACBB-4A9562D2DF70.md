# Introduction

The Microchip Design Separation methodology provides a way to create the independent critical<br /> subsystems required to implement security- and safety-critical<br /> applications on a single FPGA. Microchip Separation Verification<br /> Tool \(MSVT\) is a stand-alone tool provided with your LiberoÂ® installation. It is used to<br /> verify that your design meets the requirements of the design<br /> separation criteria. For more information, see **the Microchip Design Separation Methodology Guide**.
