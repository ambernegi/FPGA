# Instantiating Blocks in the Top-Level Design

You can instantiate multiple instances of the same block or multiple blocks in the top-level design. Microchip recommends that you create a new project for your top-level design using the following steps:

1.  From the **Project** menu, choose **New Project**.
2.  Uncheck the **Enable Designer Block Creation** check box.
3.  Choose the **Family/Die/Package** for the new project for the top-level as follows:
    -   If the block is a netlist only and was not published with place and route information, choose the same **Family** as the block for the new project. Choose any `Die and Package`.
    -   If the block contains placement information, choose the same **Family** and **Die** as the block for the new project, and choose any `Package`.
    -   If the netlist contains I/O and placement information, choose the same **Family**, **Die**, and **Package**as the block for the new project.
