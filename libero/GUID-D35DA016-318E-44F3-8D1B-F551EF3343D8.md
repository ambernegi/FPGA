# Advanced Constraints

The following section details the advanced constraints.

## Set a Disable Timing Constraint

Use disable timing constraint to specify the timing arcs to be disabled for timing consideration.

To specify a Disable Timing constraint, open the **Set Constraint to Disable Timing Arcs** dialog box in one of the following four ways:

-   In the **Constraints Browser**, double-click **Disable Timing**.
-   Click the **Add Disable Timing Constraint** ![???](GUID-9C2EF003-78EA-4FDB-A8FC-31F660851A76-low.jpg) icon.
-   From the **Constraints** menu, click **Disable Timing**.
-   Right-click any row of **Disable Timing Constraints Table** and click **Add Constraint to Disable Timing**. The **Set Constraint to Disable Timing Arcs** dialog box appears.

**Note:** This constraint is for the Place and Route tool and the Verify Timing tool. It is ignored by the Synthesis tool.

The following table describes the **Set Constraint to Disable Timing Arcs** dialog box options.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Instance Name|<br /> Specifies the instance name for which the disable timing arc<br /> constraint will be created.<br /> Click Browse next to the Instance<br /> Name box to open the Select instance to<br /> constrain dialog box.<br /> The following options are available on the Select instance<br /> to constrain dialog box:Type: Displays the type of the<br /> available pins in the design. All instances is the only<br /> valid type.Pattern: The default is \*,<br /> which is a wild-card match for all. You can specify any<br /> string value. Click Filter to<br /> filter the available pins based on the specified pin<br /> type and pattern.The list box displays the<br /> available instances. If you change the pattern value,<br /> the list box shows the available instances based on the<br /> filter.Select instances from this list and click<br /> OK to select the instance to<br /> constrain.<br />|
|Exclude All Timing Arcs in the Instance|Enables you to exclude all timing arcs in the specified<br /> instance.|
|Specify Timing Arc to Exclude|Enables you to specify the timing arc to exclude. In this case, you<br /> need to specify the from and to ports.|
|From Port|Specifies the starting point for the timing arc.|
|To Port|Specifies the ending point for the timing arc.|
|Comment|Enter a one-line comment for the constraint.|

### Specifying Disable Timing Constraint

Use disable timing constraint to specify the timing arcs being disabled.

To specify the disable timing constraint:

1.  Add the constraint in the **Editable Constraints Grid** or open the **Set Constraint to Disable Timing Arcs** dialog box using one of the following methods:
    -   From the **Constraints** menu, click **Disable Timing**.
    -   Click the ![???](GUID-96603260-E738-4CB8-900B-6D2A04FBA887-low.png) icon in the **Constraints Editor**.
    -   In the **Constraints Editor**, right-click **Disable Timing**and click **Add Disable Timing Constraints.**
2.  Select an instance from your design.
3.  Select whether you want to exclude all timing arcs in the instance or if you want to specify the timing arc to exclude. If you select **Specify timing arc to exclude**, select a from and to port for the timing arc.
4.  Enter any comments to be attached to the constraint.
5.  Click **OK**. The new constraint appears in the constraints list.

    **Note:** When you click **Save** from the **File** menu, the newly created constraint is saved in the database.


## Set Clock Source Latency Constraint

Use the clock source latency constraint to specify the delay from the clock generation point to<br /> the clock definition point in the design.

Clock source latency defines the delay between an external clock source and the definition pin of<br /> a clock.

You can specify both an "early" delay and a "late" delay for this latency, providing an<br /> uncertainty that the timing analyzer can use for propagating through its calculations.<br /> Rising and falling edges of the same clock can have different latencies. If only one<br /> clock source latency value is provided, the value is taken as the exact latency value<br /> for both rising and falling edges.

To specify a Clock Source Latency constraint, open the **Set Clock Source Latency Constraint** dialog box in one of the following four ways:

-   In the **Constraints Browser**, double-click **Clock Source Latency**.
-   Click the **Clock Source Latency Constraint** ![???](GUID-1C108EA1-1377-455A-A002-B373C075C8BC-low.jpg) icon.
-   From the **Constraints** menu, click **Clock Source Latency**.
-   Right-click any row of **Clock Latency Constraints Table** and click **Add Clock Source Latency**. The **Set Clock Source Latency Constraint** dialog box appears.

|Clock Name or Source|To select the clock source, click the **Browse**<br /> button to open the **Choose the Clock Source Pin**<br /> dialog box.The only choice available for Pin Type is<br /> Clock Pins.|
|Late Rise|Specifies the largest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the rising<br /> clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its source.<br /> Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly optimistic<br /> analysis.|
|Late Fall|Specifies the largest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the<br /> falling clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its<br /> source. Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly<br /> optimistic analysis.|
|Early Rise|Specifies the smallest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the<br /> rising clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its<br /> source. Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly<br /> optimistic analysis.|
|Early Fall|Specifies the smallest possible latency \(in nanoseconds\) of the<br /> falling clock edge at the clock port or pin selected with respect to its<br /> source. Negative values are acceptable, but may lead to overly<br /> optimistic analysis.|
|Falling same as rising|Specifies that the rising and falling clock edges have the same<br /> latency.|
|Early same as Late|<br /> Specifies that the clock source latency must be considered a single<br /> value, not a range from early to late.<br />|
|Comment|Enter a one-line comment to describe the clock source<br /> latency.|

## Set a Clock Uncertainty Constraint

Use the **Set Clock Uncertainty Constraint** dialog<br /> box to<br /> <br /> set<br /> either the<br /> [Simple Clock Uncertainty](GUID-D35DA016-318E-44F3-8D1B-F551EF3343D8.md#) constraint or<br /> the<br /> [Clock To Clock Uncertainty](GUID-D35DA016-318E-44F3-8D1B-F551EF3343D8.md#) constraint from the<br /> **Type**<br /> drop-down menu.

-   From the **Constraints** menu, click **Clock Groups**.
-   In the **Constraints Browser**, double-click **Clock Groups**.

Choose one of the following three clock group attributes for the<br /> clock group:-   **Logically Exclusive**: Use this setting for clocks that can exist physically on the device at the same time, but are logically exclusive \(for example, multiplexed clocks\).
-   **Physically Exclusive**: Use this setting for clocks that cannot exist physically on the device at the same time \(for example, multiple clocks defined on the same pin\).
-   **Asynchronous**: Use this setting when there are valid timing paths between the two clock groups, but the two clocks have no frequency or phase relationship and therefore these timing paths can be excluded from timing analysis.

Click **Add**to open a dialog<br /> box<br /> to add clocks to a clock group. In the<br /> **Available Pins** list, click the clocks, and<br /> then click **Add**to move them<br /> to<br /> the <br /> **Assigned Pins** list. Click<br /> **OK**.

</table>## Set External Delay Constraint

Use set external timing constraint to specify the external delay between user-specified<br /> From and To ports \(outside of chip\). The delay is considered during Timing Analysis for<br /> PLL external feedback delay calculation when the PLL output goes outside of the chip<br /> through the From pin, and re-enters the chip through the To pin, which then connects to<br /> the PLL feedback clock input pin.

**Important:** The Synplify Pro Synthesis software does not support this constraint. In Libero flow, this constraint is skipped for Synplify Pro Synthesis software.

To set an external delay constraint, right click any row of Set External Delay<br /> Constraints table, and then click **Add/Edit Set External Delay**.<br /> When the Add Set External Delay Constraint dialog box appears, complete the options, and<br /> then click **OK**.
