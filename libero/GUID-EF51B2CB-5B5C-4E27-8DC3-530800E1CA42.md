# Instantiating User HDL Modules, IP Cores, and Components in SmartDesign

You can add one or more HDL modules, building blocks, and components from the **Design Hierarchy** tab to your design. The components can be IP cores from the<br /> **IP Catalog** tab, basic macros, design blocks, and other SmartDesign<br /> components available from the **Components** node in the **Design Hierarchy** tree or from the **Components** tab.

## Instantiating a User HDL Module in your Design

To instantiate a user HDL source module, use either of the following procedures:

-   On the **Design Hierarchy** tab, select the user HDL module of interest, drag and drop it onto the canvas.
-   On the **Design Hierarchy** tab, right-click the user HDL module of interest and select **Instantiate in &lt;active\_SD\_name&gt;** from the right-click menu.

**Result:** The selected module is instantiated in the SmartDesign canvas.

<br />

**Tip:** Repeat these steps to instantiate all the user HDL source modules of interest in your SmartDesign canvas.

<br />

## Creating a HDL+ Core from an User HDL Source Module

To create a HDL+ core from a user HDL source module, perform the following steps:

1.  On the **Design Hierarchy** tab, right-click the user HDL file and select **Create Core from HDL** from the right-click menu. The **Edit Core Definitions – Ports and Parameters** dialog box appears.

2.  Specify the ports and parameters as required and click **OK**. A BIF might also be added to the HDL core. It shows up in the SmartDesign with a BIF pin that can easily connect to the compatible instance BIF pins.

**Result:** The selected user HDL module is converted to an HDL+ core and can<br /> be instantiated in your SmartDesign canvas.

## Configuring and Instantiating Instances in your Design

You can choose to configure and instantiate the following components in your design:

-   SmartDesign component
-   IP Core components
-   User HDL cores
-   Design blocks

**Important:** Only IP core components can be configured.

### Configuring and Instantiating an IP Core Component

Microchip offers a large portfolio of configurable cores. These cores are available from the<br /> **Catalog** tab. To instantiate an IP core component in your design, you<br /> must first configure the component.

1.  To configure and instantiate an IP core component, use either of the following procedures:

    -   On the **Catalog** tab, select the IP core component of interest, drag and drop it onto the canvas.
    -   On the **Catalog** tab, right-click the IP core component of interest and select **Instantiate in &lt;active\_SD\_name&gt;** from the right-click menu.
    -   On the **Catalog** tab, right-click the IP core component of interest and select **Configure core** from the right-click menu.
    **Result:** The **Create Component** dialog<br /> box appears.

    ![](GUID-B9D90A4F-B420-43F1-AF6D-D0421A87F13C-low.png "Create Component Dialog Box")

    By default, the selected IP core’s name is displayed in the<br /> **Name** box. You can use the next step to change the core’s name to<br /> a name of your choice.

2.  Enter an appropriate and unique name for your core component in the **Name** box and click **OK**. The **Configurator** window appears.

    ![](GUID-DE24CCBC-3AF0-48EA-8D76-3ECC7D4133AF-low.png "Configurator Window")

3.  Configure the core component as per your design requirements and click **OK**.
4.  \(Optional\) To re-configure an existing component, right-click the component and choose **Configure**. The **Configurator** window appears. Proceed with step 3 to modify the existing configuration.

**Result**: The configured IP core component is made available in the<br /> **Design Hierarchy** tab, **Components** tab, and is<br /> instantiated in your SmartDesign canvas.

**Tip:** Repeat these steps to instantiate the necessary IP core components of interest in your SmartDesign.

**Important:** If you observe that the core component that you are looking for appears in italicized-gray color in the **Catalog** tab, it means that the core component is yet to be downloaded from the Microchip IP Core Repository to your hard disk \(vault\).

Download the core component of interest from the **Catalog** tab, in either of<br /> the following ways.

-   Double-click the core component of interest.
-   Right-click the core component of interest and click **Download**.

**Result:**The core component of interest is downloaded from the Microchip<br /> vault to your local vault and is made available for configuration and instantiation.

For information on the types of available core components and its color representation, see [Appendix D – Component Types](GUID-E6ED604B-36DA-4285-89F9-3AA0E053FB0A.md).

### Instantiating SmartDesign Components, User HDL Cores, and Design Blocks in your Design

To instantiate a SmartDesign component, a user HDL core, or a design block use either of the<br /> following procedures:

-   On the **Design Hierarchy** tab, select the SmartDesign component, user HDL core, or the design block of interest, drag, and drop it onto the canvas.
-   On the **Design Hierarchy** tab, right-click the SmartDesign component, user HDL core, or the design block of interest, and select **Instantiate in &lt;active\_SD\_name&gt;** from the right-click menu.

**Result:** The selected components are instantiated in your SmartDesign.

**Tip:**

-   Repeat these steps to include the necessary SmartDesign components, user HDL cores, or design blocks of interest in your design.
-   A component is either created within the existing project or imported into the existing project. Once in the project, the method for instantiating a component in your SmartDesign is the same regardless of the component type.

## Replacing an Instance Component with a Different Component

You can choose to replace an instance\(s\) component with a different component or a different implementation while preserving the current instance’s interface \(port\) connections.

To replace an instance component with a different component, perform the following steps:

1.  Right-click the instance component and select **Replace Component** from the right-click menu. The **Replace Component for Instance\(s\)** dialog box appears.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](GUID-265B0D00-2116-4F10-A5DD-2E90FFF8BA83-low.jpg "Replace Component for Instance(s) Dialog Box")

    The instance\(s\) section shows the following information:

    -   **All Instances**: Lists all instances of the component.
    -   **Selected Instance**: Shows the selected instance that will be replaced with the new component.
    -   **Component**: The component of the selected instance.
2.  From the **New Component** dropdown list, select the replacement component of your choice.
3.  By default, the **Replace all instances using &lt;component\_name&gt; with new selected component**option is selected. When this option is selected, every instance of the selected component in the current design \(the list of instances shown under the **All Instances** group\) are replaced with the new component specified in step 2.

**Important:**

-   As a result of the replace action, if the instance port list changes, then some pins connections might be dropped. The information related to the dropped pins connection in printed in the **Log** window.
-   If the **Replace all instances using &lt;component\_name&gt; with new selected component**option is deselected, only the selected instance is replaced in the design.
-   If you select an instance and click **OK**for a non-valid component, the dialog box closes automatically, and an error message is printed in the **Log** window.

## Updating a Component Core Version

The **Update Component Version** functionality enables you to update a<br /> component of an instance with another version. You can restore or update your component<br /> without creating a new instance or losing your connections.

1.  You can update a component version in your design in either of the following ways:

    -   On the **Design Hierarchy** tab, right-click the component and select **Update Component Version** from the right-click menu.
    -   On the SmartDesign canvas, right-click the component and select **Update Component Version** from the right-click menu.
    **Result:** The **Update Component Version**dialog box appears.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](GUID-A3E6DB84-B3BD-447B-AFB1-2E56695C30A4-low.png "Update Component Version Dialog Box")

2.  The **Change to version** dropdown list contains all the versions of the selected core available in the vault. In the **Change to version** dropdown box, select the version you want to upgrade to and click **OK**.

    **Result:** The core is automatically<br /> downloaded to the vault if it does not already exist in the vault. If the core exists in<br /> the vault, the component in the SmartDesign canvas is upgraded with the selected<br /> version.


**Important:** You cannot upgrade to a different version of the core that is not in your vault and if the vault is read-only.

## Updating the Component Instance Port List

When the lower-level component port list is modified, the higher-level component is highlighted<br /> in red color and an exclamation symbol in shown within a red colored triangle at the top right<br /> corner of the component as shown in the following figure. This means that the instance port<br /> list needs to be updated.

![](GUID-A8608F7E-A3F6-4A04-85BB-11D13920B542-low.png "Higher-level Component Highlighted in Red Color with Tooltip for User Action")

Perform the following steps in the recommended order when the port list of the lower-level component is modified:

1.  Go to the next higher-level of the design hierarchy containing lower-port modifications.
2.  Right-click the lower-level component and select **Update Instance** from the right-click menu.
3.  Generate the higher-level component in which the instance is updated.

**Result:**The red colored triangle at the top right corner of the component disappears if the<br /> component update is successful.

## Performing Additional Operations on Components

When one or more instances are selected, you can use the right-click menu to perform the<br /> following operations.

**Note:** Some operations are applicable only on a single instance.
