# HSM Programming or Debug Job

A programming or debug job can be set up for execution in an untrusted environment. In this case,<br /> the M-HSM protects cryptographic key material and other sensitive data required by device<br /> security protocols during the manufacturing processes.

HSM data is added to the Programming or Debug Job with HSM Task\(s\). See [HSM Tasks](GUID-A4CAEB4B-478D-4219-964C-9D68780F14EC.md#) for details. A Programming Data<br /> entry is created in the Job Manager project using the<br /> `new_prog_job` Tcl command.
