# Creation and Execution of non-HSM Jobs

The creation of a non-HSM job is similar to an HSM Job with the exception that there is no IHP<br /> job type option, and the job is exported directly without HSM<br /> Tasks \(see [Adding HSM Data to the Job through HSM Tasks](GUID-BFB233D2-653B-4FD5-B65F-F6B4EBB72812.md#)\).

The user adds target and bypass devices. Target Microchip devices are associated with the<br /> bitstreams in Programing Data.

Job generation is done at the job level \(explained in the [Job Manager User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/spps_job_mgr_ug.pdf)\). The created job is sent to Production and<br /> can only be executed by FlashPro Express<br /> programming software.
