# SmartHLS License

Learn how to obtain a free license for SmartHLS.

## License Setup Instructions

Starting version 2024.2, SmartHLS no longer requires a separate<br /> license. SmartHLS is supported using the Libero SoC Design<br /> Suite license.

For SmartHLS 2024.1 and earlier, you need to upgrade your<br /> Libero license. Your upgraded Libero license is available for download after the release<br /> of Libero SoC 2024.2. With the upgraded Libero license, you can use SmartHLS 2024.1 and earlier without a separate SmartHLS license.

To download your upgraded Libero license, log on to your [Microchip Direct](https://www.microchipdirect.com/fpga-software-products) account. For instructions on how to setup a<br /> Libero license, see the Libero SoC Software Download and License Installation Guide<br /> [License Installation](GUID-40BFB012-128A-4850-8C3C-FE907B6FCD5D.md).

If you face any licensing issues while running SmartHLS, make sure that you have a valid Libero license available.

## When is the License Checked?

SmartHLSâ„¢ does not check the license when opening the SmartHLS IDE or when running the standard software flow \(compiling/debugging/execution\).

SmartHLS will check for a valid license when **Compile Software to Hardware** is clicked to compile software to hardware:
