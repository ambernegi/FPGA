# Horizontal Navigation

When large designs do not fit into one single page for display, especially in the case of<br /> flattened netlist, the Netlist Viewer splits the design netlist into multiple pages.<br /> Page splitting enables you to quickly compute and display the schematic netlist view.<br /> You can turn on and turn off page splitting to view your netlist.

When the **Split Page**option is enabled, navigate the netlist horizontally<br /> in one of three ways:

-   Go to Next Page—Click the Next Page icon on the toolbar to go to the next page.
-   Go to Previous Page—Click the Previous Page icon on the toolbar to go to the previous page.
-   Go to &lt;page number&gt;—Enter the specific page number to go to.

    **Tip:** **Go to &lt;page number&gt;** always displays the current page number by default.

-   Double clicking a net that spans across multiple pages jumps to the next page where the net is on.
