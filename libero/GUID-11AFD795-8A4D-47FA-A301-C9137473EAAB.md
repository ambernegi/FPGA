# REFCLK to Lanes Connectivity

The REFCLK of a quad can connect to all Lanes of the TXPLL \(in addition to<br /> that which the REFCLK can connect\), as well as all the other Lanes below it \(including from<br /> different quads\). Connection up the Cascade path is illegal.

Green arrows indicate legal connection and red arrows indicate illegal connection from the REFCLK to the Lanes.
