# Copying Design Objects

Select the design object in the view. Use CTRL+C to copy the name of design<br /> objects \(nets/instances/ports/pins/macros\). The object name is copied to your clipboard.<br /> Use CTRL+V to paste the design object name from the clipboard to the<br /> Filter window of the Design Tree. This is helpful when searching for components in the<br /> design tree or when the design object name is very long with hierarchical separators in<br /> the name.
