# PDC Setting

A PDC file is not needed for these I/Os because the settings from the MSS Configurator are being<br /> used. If the user specifies a correct placement and I/O standard, the tool will accept<br /> the userâ€™s settings and will not error-out. But if the user tries to set any of the<br /> other specific MSS I/O attributes, it will fail. These constraints will not be written<br /> in the generated PDC file from the Chip Planner.
