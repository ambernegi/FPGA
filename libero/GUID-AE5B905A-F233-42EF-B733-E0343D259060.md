# The Netlist Viewer User Interface

Netlist Viewer is a GUI designed for you to traverse the design hierarchy and to examine the nets<br /> for debugging purposes. It has a rich set of icons for navigating the netlist, both<br /> vertically \(up and down the design hierarchy\) and horizontally \(to different pages of<br /> the netlist view\).
