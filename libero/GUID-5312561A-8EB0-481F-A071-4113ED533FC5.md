# Report Conclusion

When MSVT completes successfully, the report shows the following final message:

```
Design has met 2 switches separation requirement
MSVT Check succeeded.
Number of errors: 0
```

**Note:** In the message above, `number of errors` shows the total number of errors that MSVT reported in the output report.

The report shows the following final message for MSVT separation criteria failure:
