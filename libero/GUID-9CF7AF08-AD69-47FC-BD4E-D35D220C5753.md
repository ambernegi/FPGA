# Generic I/O Assignments

Drag the I/O port from the Ports tab and drop it to the spreadsheet-like table to make the I/O assignment. The multi-line comment shows the locations where you can legally place the I/O port. Green indicates legal placements, and red indicates illegal placements. Illegal assignments are not allowed.
