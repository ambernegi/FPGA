# Analyzing a Floorplan

MSVT extracts the separation between each pair of blocks in the design, which may help identify violations in the floorplan. For each pair of blocks in a design, the following information is generated in the `Analyzing floorplan` section of the report. This information can be used to identify, which blocks lack sufficient cluster separation between them that can lead to an MSVT failure.

-   **Floorplan Separation**: Shows the minimum separation between the respective routing regions in cluster units. If there is no overlap between the X and Y dimensions of the two regions, this is indicated as “diagonal.”
-   **Placement Separation**: Shows the minimum separation between the actual placements of instances in each block in cluster units. If there is no overlap between the X and Y dimensions of the placements of instances of the two blocks, this is indicated as “diagonal.”

**Note:** The coordinates shown for blocks is presented in terms of clusters.

## Design Example

For example, consider blocks `block4_0` and `block2_0` separated in MVN, as shown in the following figure.

## MSVT Output Report

In the sample report section shown in the following, the floorplan separation indicates that the regions to which blocks `block4_0` and `block2_0` are assigned are separated by 9 clusters.

Placement separation between instances of blocks `block4_0` and `block2_0` is placed in 21 clusters. `block4_0` at \(144,62\) suggests that the `block4_0` region spans from cluster 144 in the X-direction and cluster 62 in the Y-direction.
