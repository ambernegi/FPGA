# Right Click Mouse Menu Items

Right clicking on a design object such as an Instance, net, module, or pin opens a menu.<br /> This menu is context-sensitive and varies with the kind of design objects and the view<br /> \(RTL, Flattened, or Hierarchical\). Some of the menu items may contain sub-menu<br /> items.

The following table lists the menu items for all views and all design objects.

**Tip:** Some menu items are specific to a view or a design object.

|Name|Description|Shown When|Notes|
|----|-----------|----------|:---:|
|Push Instance|Pushes into the module selected.|Pushable Module \(Not the lowest level\) is selected.|—|
|Expand Inplace/ Fold Instance|Expands the current module in place inside the current view or folds<br /> the current instance inside the current view.|Pushable Module is selected.|For more information, see [Fold Instance](GUID-8FD38015-3DE5-45D2-80B9-4D29BA71B40E.md) and<br /> [Expand InPlace](GUID-C76842B0-10D2-4970-9A77-73700B5E85CC.md).|
|Get Inst Param|Collects all instance parameters and shows them in a table on a<br /> separate window.|An Instance with parameters is selected. An example is a RAM HDL<br /> module or entity that has parameterized address bus width and data bus<br /> width in the HDL code.|—|
|Open File Location|Displays the netlist file in a new tab. The cursor goes to the<br /> definition of the item selected. The file is opened for read-only and is<br /> not editable.|When a Verilog/VHDL/EDIF netlist is opened, and the location of the<br /> module in the netlist file is available.|Available only in RTL and Hierarchical<br /> views of stand-alone Netlist Viewer.|
|Go To Net Driver|Goes to the driver of the net selected.|Only one net is selected.|Behavior is affected by the Local Selection<br /> Mode. In Local Selection mode, the driver on the current level is<br /> selected. Otherwise, the lowest level driver is selected \(may be on a<br /> different level\) across hierarchical boundaries.|
|Follow Net|Follows a net to the components it is connected to.|Shown when a net/net bundle that spans multiple pages or crosses<br /> hierarchical boundaries is selected.|Does not appear if net/net bundle is not<br /> selected. Disabled if net is contained in the current page.|
|Follow Pin|Follows pin to the driver/load of the pin.|A pin on an instance is selected.|Highlights the net attached to the pin as<br /> well as the driver/load of the net.|
|Magnify Pin|Creates a magnified view of the pin.|A pin on an instance is selected.|For more information, see [Magnifying Pins](GUID-FFD0B4DE-4A9F-4AB9-ABA6-4FB68F1D8CDF.md).|
|Add to Active Cone &gt; Selection|Adds current selected design objects to the Active Cone.|—|Available only when at least one<br /> net/instance is selected.|
|Add to Active Cone &gt; Driver|Adds the Driver of all nets and instances selected to<br /> the Active Cone.|Contains sub-menu to select the number of logic level to traverse to<br /> collect all the drivers. Max logic level is 10.|Available only when at least one<br /> net/instance is selected.|
|Add to Active Cone &gt; Load|Adds the Load of all nets and instances selected to the Active<br /> Cone.|Contains sub-menu to select the number of logic level to<br /> traverse to collect all the loads. Max logic level is 10.|Available only when at least one<br /> net/instance is selected.|
|Add to Active Cone &gt; All Connected Logic|Adds all instances connected to adjacent nets to the active<br /> cone.|—|Available only when at least one instance<br /> is selected.|
|Pop Instance|Pops out of the current module into the next higher level of<br /> hierarchy.|Currently not on the top level of the design hierarchy.|—|
