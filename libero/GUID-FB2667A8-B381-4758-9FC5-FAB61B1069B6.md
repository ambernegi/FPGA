# Creation of Programming Bitstream Files

The bitstream file can be exported after the bitstream initialization step is complete. The Job Manager supports different file formats \(STAPL, SPI, DAT, and so on\). For more information, see the [Job Manager User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/spps_job_mgr_ug.pdf).

The generated bitstream file can be sent for production to program the devices using FlashPro, DirectC, Silicon Sculptor, IAP/ISP services, or other third-party programming tools that support STAPL format.
