# Using the Smart Search and Connect Tool

The **Smart Search and Connect** tool manages large designs with many<br /> pins, ports, and nets to connect. Design objects can be searched and connected easily without<br /> looking at the SmartDesign canvas. You can see the connections on the SmartDesign canvas as<br /> you make them. Any errors in the design are printed in the **Log**<br /> window.

The **Smart Search and Connect** tool also help with complex searching and<br /> efficiently connecting multiple objects \(clocks, resets, and so on\) at the same time. You can<br /> search items using keywords and filters, select them, and then connect them using the<br /> right-click menu options. Alternatively, you can click **Connect** or<br /> **Disconnect** in the **Smart Search and Connect**<br /> tool window. It is possible to keep the result of a search by pinning the desired items and<br /> performing multiple searches. The pinned items are retained and available in search results,<br /> even if they do not match search patterns.

To launch the **Smart Search and Connect** tool, use either of the<br /> following methods:

1.  On the menu, click **Edit** and select **Find**.
2.  On the SmartDesign toolbar, click the **Smart Search and Connect** toggle icon.

**Result:** By default, the dockable **Smart Search and Connect** dialog box appears to the right side of the canvas. You can undock the<br /> tool window and move it a different location in the SmartDesign tool window as needed.

## Searching for Design Objects in the Canvas

You can use the **Search** box in the **Smart Search and Connect** tool to search and connect design objects. The<br /> **Search** box uses the following search pattern:<br /> **\[Type\]:\[Instance\].\[Pin\]**.

**Important:** You can keep searched items by pinning them. Pinned items remain visible through multiple searches.

You can do a simple search when your search consists of only alphanumerical characters.<br /> All pins, ports, instances, and nets that match the search pattern appears in the search<br /> results tree view automatically. If the search pattern has the “`.`”<br /> separator symbol, SmartDesign tool treats the part before the separator as an instance<br /> name and the part after as a pin name.

You can also search by the following keywords: **port:**,<br /> **pin:**, **instance:**,<br /> **net:**, and **\*:**. Alternatively, you can<br /> use their abbreviated versions. You must specify the keywords at the beginning of the<br /> search pattern.

The SmartDesign canvas zooms in and highlights the design object. Zoom out far enough,<br /> with the design object still selected, to see the rest of the design and make the net<br /> connections.

## Narrowing the Search for Design Objects Using Filters

You can use the narrow search filter button \(![](GUID-BA6CE532-BB76-4ACE-8E21-1D273DFE7D0D-low.png)\) to filter the design objects based on either pin or port<br /> directions or pin or port types or with a combination of both in the Smart Search and<br /> Connect tool. The selected filter is applied on the search results and are displayed in<br /> the treeview.

The following table depicts the filter states.

|Icon State|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|![???](GUID-BA6CE532-BB76-4ACE-8E21-1D273DFE7D0D-low.png)|Filter is selected|
|![???](GUID-95F852F2-D9C8-4D65-B7E6-F6BDA93DD2B6-low.png)|No filter is selected|

## Applying the Selected Filters on the Design Objects in the Canvas

You can apply the selected filters and display only a subset of the SmartDesign objects<br /> using the **Filter** toggle button in the **Smart Search and Connect** tool. This view is suitable to use with large designs to focus<br /> on a particular structure of the design, such as the clock, reset structure, or AMBA<br /> sub-systems for instance.

To create a filtered view in the SmartDesign canvas, click **Filter**<br /> in the **Smart Search and Connect** tool. The SmartDesign canvas<br /> applies the filters and redraws the canvas with the filtered design objects visible in<br /> the **Smart Search and Connect** tools treeview.

**Important:** The filtered SmartDesign canvas with the object\(s\) are **_read-only_**.

In the **Filtered** canvas view, except for the navigation commands<br /> all other editorial commands and right-click options are disabled. The<br /> **Filtered** canvas view is created with a cone structure. To add<br /> new objects to the filtered canvas, double-click the dotted nets to see all the<br /> connected nets to these nets in an expanded view. The net appears dotted if it is<br /> connected to an instance that is not included in the filtered view. You can double-click<br /> the dotted net to load all the instances connected to that net.

To add new objects to the filtered view from the Smart Search and Connect tool’s treeview<br /> results, right-click the object of interest and select **Add to Filtered View**. When you add a pin or port to the filtered view, the tool adds the<br /> net connected to the object\(s\).

To exit the read-only filtered view to a normal SmartDesign canvas, perform the following<br /> steps:

-   Toggle the **Undo Filter** button.
-   Close the **Smart Search and Connect** window using **X** button.
-   Press **Ctrl+Z** or **Undo** button.

## Connecting and Disconnecting the Ports or Pins

You can choose to connect or disconnect pins and ports in your design.

### Connecting Pins or Ports

You can connect the unconnected pins or ports in either of the following ways:

-   In the Smart Search and Connect tool’s treeview, hold the **Ctrl** key pressed, select the unconnected pins or ports that you want to connect, and click the **Connect** button in the Smart Search and Connect tool window.
-   In the SmartDesign canvas, hold the **Ctrl** key pressed, select the unconnected pins or ports that you want to connect, right-click on any of the selected pin or port, and select the **Connect** option.

**Result:** Connections are made between the selected pins or<br /> ports.

### Disconnecting Pins or Ports

You can disconnect the connected pins or ports in either of the following ways:

-   In the Smart Search and Connect tool’s treeview, hold the **Ctrl** key pressed, select the connected pins or ports that you want to disconnect, and click the **Disconnect** button in the Smart Search and Connect tool window.
-   In the SmartDesign canvas, hold the **Ctrl** key pressed, select the connected pins or ports that you want to disconnect, right-click on any of the selected pin or port, and click the **Disconnect** option.

**Result:** Connections between the selected pins or ports are<br /> disconnected.
