# SDC Timing Constraints

In the Libero IP core reference project, this top-level SDC constraint file is available<br /> from the Constraint Manager \(`Design Flow > Open Manage Constraint View >Timing > Derive Constraints`\).

**Important:** See this file to set the SDC constraints if your design contains CCC, OSC, Transceiver, and other components. Modify the full hierarchical path, if necessary, to match your design hierarchy or use the Derive\_Constraints utility and steps in [Appendix C—Derive Constraints](GUID-05E323D6-53B9-484F-8989-7AB23AB58F56.md) on the component level SDC file. Save the file to a different name and import the SDC file to the synthesis tool, Place-and-Route Tool, and Timing Verifications, just like any other SDC constraint files.
