# Bank Name

This is a read-only field to identify the I/O bank the I/O pin is<br /> associated with. Devices may five, six, or eight user I/O banks \(Bank 0 through Bank 7\),<br /> depending on the device size. Each pin is associated with an I/O bank. The I/O banks on the<br /> north side of the device support only HSIO. Each I/O bank has dedicated I/O supplies and<br /> grounds. Each I/O within a given bank shares the same VDDI power supply, and the same VREF<br /> reference voltage. Only compatible I/O standards can be assigned to a given I/O bank.
