# Bottleneck Options

**Cost Type**: Select the cost type that SmartTime will include in the<br /> Bottleneck Report. By default, path count is selected. You can select one of the<br /> following two items from the drop-down list:

-   **Path Count**: This cost type associates the severity of the bottleneck to the count of violating/critical paths that traverse the instance. This is the default.
-   **Path Cost**: This cost type associates the severity of the bottleneck to the sum of the timing violations for the violating/critical paths that traverse the instance.

**Limit the number of paths per section to**: Specify the maximum number of<br /> paths per set type that SmartTime will include per section in the report. The default<br /> maximum number of paths reported is 100.

**Limit the number of parallel paths per section to**: For each expanded path,<br /> specify the maximum number of parallel paths that SmartTime will include in the report.<br /> Only cells that lie on these violating paths are reported. The default number of<br /> parallel paths is 1.

**Limit the number of reported instances**: Specify the maximum number of<br /> cells that SmartTime will include per section in the report. The default number of cells<br /> is 10.
