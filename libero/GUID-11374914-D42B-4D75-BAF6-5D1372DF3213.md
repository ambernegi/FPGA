# Closing a View

To close the opened view, click an opened view at the top of the Netlist<br /> Viewer. A closed view stays in system memory as long as the Netlist Viewer remains open.<br /> Opening the same netlist view at a later time does not incur runtime penalty, as no loading<br /> is required.
