In the crypto modes:

<br />

-   The status pins and interrupt pins are available as configuration options in all the ownership modes except the MSS ownership mode.
-   There are three options that expose the DLL lock, Busy, and Mesh ports. The Busy and DLL Lock are ON by default, while the Mesh input pin connects to 0 when not used.
-   The **Use embedded DLL in fabric interface** is always provided in all modes and is enabled by default when the **Enable streaming interface** option is selected.
