# Vref

Any GPIO and HSIO pad on the device can be configured to act as an external VREF to supply all inputs within a bank. Use this field to configure the I/O as VREF to other I/Os. When an I/O pad is configured as Vref \(voltage referenced\), all I/O buffer modes and terminations on that pad are disabled.
