# Introduction

The Job Manager tool is a part of the Secured Production Programming Solution \(SPPS\) ecosystem that consists of the LiberoÂ®, Job Manager, and FlashPro Express applications as well as User HSM servers \(U-HSM\) and Manufacturer HSM servers \(M-HSM\).

This user guide describes how to use the Job Manager to organize manufacturing flow as described<br /> in the [Secure Production Programming Solution \(SPPS\) User Guide](https://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/spps_ug.pdf).

The Job Manager is primarily intended for use by the Operation Engineer \(OE\) who is responsible for the manufacturing process organization and security.

The current version of the Job Manager is based on the Tcl interface running in command-line mode. The Job Manager supports the creation of:

-   Programming Jobs for the regular production programming flow \(non-HSM manufacturing flow in this document\)
-   Programming Jobs for the secured production programming flow \(HSM-based manufacturing flow in this document\)
-   Bitstream files in various formats \(STAPL, DAT, SPI, and so on\) for use by third-party programming tools \(non-HSM flow\)

Programming Jobs created by the Job Manager can be programmed into the device using FlashPro Express \(see the [FlashPro Express User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/flashpro_express_ug.pdf)\) or In House Programming \(IHP\).

Programming bit stream generation supported by the Job Manager is based on design information imported from Libero. eNVM/sNVM data and security settings can be modified in the Job Manager project, which allows update of areas such as M3 firmware image and enforcement of security policies.

The Job Manager allows generation of the programming bitstreams outside the Libero flow, eliminating the need for the OE to handle the design using Libero, obtain design level Libero licenses, and address design migration to newer versions of Libero.
