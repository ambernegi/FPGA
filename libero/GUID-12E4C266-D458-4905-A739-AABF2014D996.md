# Extracting MSVT Files

The information used by the MSVT is exported while generating the programming file. The tool takes as input the design database and a parameter file that is generated once per project. The parameter file describes the isolation regions in the design as well as the inter-region signals between isolation regions. The parameter file is exported to the following location:

```
<project_path>/designer/<Top_Level_Module>/msvt.param
```
