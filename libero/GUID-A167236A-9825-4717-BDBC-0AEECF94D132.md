# Setting the Target Cone

While multiple cone views may co-exist, only one of them is active \(the Target cone\) at a time.<br /> There is only one Target Cone each for the ADL Hierarchical netlist view, AFL Flattened<br /> netlist view, and RTL view. The Target Cone is identified by the suffix “- Target” in<br /> the cone name. Design objects, when added to a Logical Cone, are always added to the<br /> Target Cone only. When no logical cones exist and design objects are added, Netlist<br /> Viewer creates a new logical cone and sets it as the Target Cone to display the design<br /> objects. Whenever a new logical cone is created \(Create Cone icon clicked\), the new cone<br /> is set as the Target Cone.

To set as Target Cone:

1.  Select the **cone** view.
2.  Click the **Set as Active** icon on the toolbar.
