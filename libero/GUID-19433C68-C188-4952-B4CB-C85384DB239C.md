# Design Flows with SmartTime

You can access SmartTime in Libero SoC during the following design implementation phases:

-   During Place and Route—when you select timing-driven place-and-route, SmartTime runs in the background to provide accurate timing information.
-   After Place and Route—run SmartTime to perform post-layout timing analysis and adjust timing constraints. In the Libero SoC Design Flow window, expand **Implement Design &gt; Verify Post-Layout Implementation** and then either:
    -   Double-click **Verify Timing** to generate Timing Reports.
    -   Right-click **Open SmartTime &gt; Open Interactively** to run SmartTime.
-   During Back-Annotation—SmartTime runs in the background to generate the SDF file for timing simulation.

You can also run SmartTime to generate Timing Reports, regardless of which design implementation<br /> phase you are in.

For more information about Place and Route and Back-Annotation, see the [Libero SoC Design Flow User Guide](http://coredocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Libero/2025_1/Tool/libero_ecf_ug.pdf).
