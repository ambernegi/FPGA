# ODT Imp \(Ohm\)

On-die termination \(ODT\) is the technology where the termination resistor for impedance matching in transmission lines is located inside a semiconductor chip instead of on a printed circuit board.

Port Configuration \(PC\) bits are static configuration bits set during<br /> programming to configure the I/O\(s\) as per your choice. See your device datasheet for a<br /> full range of possible values.
