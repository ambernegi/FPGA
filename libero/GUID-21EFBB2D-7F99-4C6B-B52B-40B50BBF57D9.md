# Component Configuration

The first step in the custom flow is to configure your components using a Libero reference<br /> project \(also called first Libero project in [Table   1](GUID-A37221FD-A433-48C8-92E2-E0E51BC1034D.md#TABLE_LHF_YHH_YPB)\). In<br /> subsequent steps, you will use data from this reference project.

If you are using any components listed earlier, under the [Overview](GUID-A37221FD-A433-48C8-92E2-E0E51BC1034D.md)<br /> in your design, perform the steps described in this section.

If you are not using any of the above components, you can write your RTL outside of Libero and directly import it into your Synthesis and Simulation tools. You can then proceed to the post-synthesis section and only import your post-synthesis `*.edn` or `*.vm netlist` into your final Libero implementation project \(also called second Libero project in [Table   1](GUID-A37221FD-A433-48C8-92E2-E0E51BC1034D.md#TABLE_LHF_YHH_YPB)\).
