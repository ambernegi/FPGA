# PDC Syntax Conventions

The following table shows the typographical conventions that are used for the PDC command syntax.

|Syntax Notation|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|`command`-argument|Commands and arguments appear in Courier New typeface.|
|`variable`|Variables appear in Courier New typeface. You must substitute an<br /> appropriate value for the variable.|
|`[-argument value] [variable]+`|Optional arguments begin and end with a square bracket with one<br /> exception: if the square bracket is followed by a plus sign \(+\), users<br /> must specify at least one argument. The plus sign \(+\) indicates that<br /> items within the square brackets can be repeated. Do not enter the plus<br /> sign character.|

**Note:** PDC commands are case sensitive. However, their arguments are not.

## Examples

Syntax for the `set_io` command followed by a sample command:

```
set_io portname [-iostd value][-register value][-out_drive value][-slew value][- res_pull
value][-out_load value][-pinname value][-fixed value][-in_delay value] set_io ADDOUT2 \
-iostd PCI \
-register yes \
-out_drive 16 \ -slew high \
-out_load 10 \
-pinname T21 \
-fixed yes
```

## Wildcard Characters

You can use the following wildcard characters in names used in PDC commands:

|Wildcard|What It Does|
|--------|------------|
|\\|Interprets the next character literally|
|?|Matches any single character|
|\*|Matches any string|

**Note:** The matching function requires that you add a slash \(\\\) before each slash in the port, instance, or net name when using wildcards in a PDC command.

## Special Characters \(\[ \], \{ \}, and \\\)

Sometimes square brackets are part of the command syntax. In these cases, you must either enclose the open and closed square brackets characters with curly brackets or precede the open and closed square brackets characters with a backslash \(\\\). If you do not, you will get an error message.

For example:

`set_iobank {mem_data_in[57]} -fixed no 7 2`

`or set_iobank mem_data_in\[57\] -fixed no 7 2`

## Entering Arguments on Separate Lines

To enter an argument on a separate line, you must enter a backslash \(\\\) character at the end of the preceding line of the command as shown in the following example:

```
set_io ADDOUT2 \
-iostd PCI \
-register Yes \
-out_drive 16 \
-slew High \
-out_load 10 \
-pinname T21 \
-fixed yes
```
