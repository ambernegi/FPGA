# report

## Description

Specifies the type of reports to be generated and the type of Analysis \(Max Delay or Min Delay\)<br /> performed to generate the reports. Using this command, you can generate the<br /> following types of reports:

-   Timer report—This report displays the timing information organized by clock domain.
-   Timing Violations report—This flat slack report provides information about constraint violations.
-   Bottleneck report—This report displays the points in the design that contribute to the most timing violations.
-   Datasheet report—This report describes the characteristics of the pins, I/O technologies, and timing properties in the design.
-   Constraints Coverage report—This report displays the overall coverage of the timing constraints set on the current design.
-   Combinational Loop report—This report displays loops found during initialization.
-   Clock Domain Crossing report—This report analyzes timing paths that cross from one clock domain \(the source clock\) to another clock domain \(the destination clock\).

If the specified parameter/value is not correct, this command fails.

</table>|Parameter/Value|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|max\_parallel\_paths &lt;number&gt;|Specifies the max number of parallel paths. Parallel paths are timing paths with the same start and end points.|
|max\_paths &lt;number&gt;|Specifies the max number of paths to display for each set. This value is a positive integer value greater than zero. Default is 100.|
|print\_summary \(yes\|no\)|Yes to include and No to exclude the summary section in the timing report.|
|use\_slack\_threshold \(yes\|no\)|Yes to include slack threshold and no to exclude threshold in the timing report. The default is to exclude slack threshold.|
|slack\_threshold &lt;double&gt;|Specifies the threshold value to consider when reporting path slacks. This value is in nanoseconds \(ns\). By default, there is no threshold \(all slacks reported\).|
|print\_paths &lt;yes\|no&gt;|Specifies whether the path section \(clock domains and in-to-out paths\) will be printed in the timing report. Yes to include path sections \(default\) and no to exclude path sections from the timing report.|
|max\_expanded\_paths &lt;number&gt;<br />|Specifies the max number of paths to expand per set. This value is a positive integer value greater than zero. Default is 100.|
|include\_user\_sets \(yes\|no\)|If yes, the user set is included in the timing report. If no, the user set is excluded in the timing report.|
|include\_clock\_domains \(yes\|no\)|Yes to include and no to exclude clock domains in the timing report.|
|select\_clock\_domains &lt;clock\_name\_list&gt;orSelect\_clock\_domains -yes -clock\_domain &lt;clock\_name\_list&gt;|Defines the clock domain to be considered in the clock domain section. The<br /> domain list is a series of strings with domain names separated by<br /> spaces. Both the summary and the path sections in the timing report<br /> display only the listed clock domains in the<br /> `clock_name_list`.|
|limit\_max\_paths \(yes\|no\)|Yes to limit the number of paths to report. No to specify that there is no<br /> limit to the number of paths to report \(default\).|
|include\_pin\_to\_pin \(yes\|no\)|Yes to include and no to exclude pin-to-pin paths in the timing report.|

Specifies the cost\_type as either path\_count or path\_cost. For path\_count, instances with the greatest number of path violations will have the highest bottleneck cost. For path\_cost, instances with the largest combined timing violations will have the highest bottleneck cost.

</td></tr><tr><td>

max\_instances &lt;number&gt;

</td><td>

Specifies the maximum number of instances to be reported. Default is 10.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>## Example

The following example generates a timing violation report named `timing_viol.txt`. The report considers an analysis using maximum delays and does not filter paths based on slack threshold. It reports two paths per section and one expanded path per section:

```
report \ -type violations \ -analysis max \ -use_slack_threshold no \ -limit_max_paths yes \ -max_paths 2 \ -max_expanded_paths 1 \ timing_viol.txt
```

The following example generates a datasheet report named `datasheet.csv` in CSV format:

```
report -type datasheet -format csv datasheet.csv 
```

You can use any one of the following examples to report inter-clock domain timing paths:

```
report -type timing -select_clock_domains yes -clock_domain { clk1 clk2 } report1.txt 
```

or

```
report -type timing -select_clock_domains { clk1 clk2 } report2.txt
```
