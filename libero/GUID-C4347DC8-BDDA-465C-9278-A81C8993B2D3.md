# Placement DRC Rules

The I/O Editor enforces the DRC rules when Transceivers are placed. Any illegal connection is highlighted as a red line in the Placement View and a corresponding message is displayed in the Log window.

Lane assignments are always legal. DRC rules are enforced for the following:

-   Connection from Transmit PLL \(TXPLL\) to the Lanes
-   Connection from the Reference Clock \(REFCLK\) to the Transmit PLL \(TXPLL\)
-   Connection from the Reference Clock \(REFCLK\) to the Lanes
