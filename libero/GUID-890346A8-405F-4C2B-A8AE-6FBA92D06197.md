# Introduction

This macro library guide supports the RTG4™ FPGA<br /> family. See the Microchip website for macro guides for other families. This guide follows a<br /> naming convention for sequential macros that is unambiguous and extensible, making it<br /> possible to understand the function of the macros by their name alone.

The first two mandatory characters of the macro name indicates the basic<br /> macro function:

-   DF—D-type flip-flop

The following mandatory character indicates the output polarity:

-   I—output inverted \(QN with bubble\)
-   N—output non-inverted \(Q without bubble\)

The following mandatory number indicates the polarity of the clock or<br /> gate:

-   1—rising edge-triggered flip-flop or transparent high latch \(non-bubbled\)
-   0—falling edge-triggered flip-flop or transparent low latch \(bubbled\)

The following two optional characters indicate the polarity of the Enable<br /> pin, if present:

-   E0—active-low enable \(bubbled\)
-   E1—active-high enable \(non-bubbled\)

The following two optional characters indicate the polarity of the<br /> asynchronous Preset pin, if present:

-   P0—active-low asynchronous preset \(bubbled\)
-   P1—active-high asynchronous preset \(non-bubbled\)

The following two optional characters indicate the polarity of the<br /> asynchronous Clear pin, if present:

-   C0—active-low asynchronous clear \(bubbled\)
-   C1—active-high asynchronous clear \(non-bubbled\)

All sequential and combinatorial macros \(except MX4 and XOR8\) use one<br /> logic element in the RTG4 family.

For example, the macro DFN1E1C0 indicates a D-type flip-flop \(DF\) with a<br /> non-inverted \(N\) Q output, positive-edge-triggered \(1\), with Active-High Clock Enable \(E1\)<br /> and Active-Low Asychronous Clear \(C0\). See the following figure.

## Truth Table Notation

The truth table states in this User Guide are defined as follows.

|State|Meaning|
|-----|-------|
|0|Logic “0”|
|1|Logic “1”|
|X|Don't Care \(for Inputs\), Unknown \(for<br /> Outputs\)|
|Z|High Impedance|

## User Parameter/Generics

### WARNING\_MSGS\_ON

This feature enables you to disable the warning messages display. Default is ON<br /> \('True' in VHDL and '1' in Verilog\).
